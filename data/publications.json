      "abstract": "This paper presents a method to create simpler versions of reinforcement learning (RL) environments using the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. The method was tested in OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car and Lunar Lander environments. Results show that these SINDy-based models can closely match the real environment's behavior while cutting down computational cost by 20–35%. With just 75 data points for Mountain Car and 1000 for Lunar Lander, the models achieved over 0.997 state-wise correlation, with very low prediction errors (as low as 3.11 × 10⁻⁶ for Mountain Car velocity and 1.42 × 10⁻⁶ for Lunar Lander position). RL agents trained in these simplified environments needed fewer steps to learn (65,075 vs. 100,000 for Mountain Car and 801,000 vs. 1,000,000 for Lunar Lander) and performed similarly to those trained in the full environments. This work offers a fast and accurate way to create interpretable models for use in model-based RL.",

      "abstract": "Building control systems typically use either setpoint regulation, where controllers determine optimal setpoints for low-level systems, or direct actuator control, which bypasses the setpoint layer. Despite widespread hierarchical approaches, empirical evidence comparing these strategies remains limited. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of both paradigms using reinforcement learning (RL) with the Building Optimization Performance Test (BOPTEST) framework. We implement and compare: (1) setpoint-trained RL agents using PPO, DQN, and A2C algorithms, (2) direct actuation-controlled RL agents with identical algorithms, and (3) a conventional PI controller baseline. Experiments span two simulation environments (BESTEST Hydronic Heat Pump and BESTEST Air systems) with constant electricity pricing. Results demonstrate that setpoint regulation achieves near-perfect thermal comfort (> 99% discomfort reduction) with modest energy cost increases (4.8–5.0%), while direct actuator control offers smaller energy penalties (1.8–3.2%) with substantial comfort improvements (> 80% discomfort reduction). Most significantly, setpoint regulation consistently demonstrated faster learning, requiring 48–79% fewer training steps across algorithms and environments. The setpoint-trained approach also exhibited 38% lower control signal variance (measured as the standard deviation of actuator commands) over the 14-day testing period. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting a two-level control architecture, where an RL agent optimizes setpoints for existing low-level controllers, while also identifying conditions where direct actuator control by an RL agent may be advantageous. Our research contributes valuable empirical insights for designing energy-efficient building control strategies using reinforcement learning, with setpoint regulation offering significant advantages in training efficiency and control stability.",

The integration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with epidemiological models offers a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases and developing effective strategies to control and mitigate their impact. In this study, we develop a novel hybrid approach to modelling and forecasting the dynamics and the demand for healthcare resources. We take advantage of the concept of PINNs to capture the dynamics of infectious diseases, estimate key parameters, and unobserved states in the ability of the model, using the neural network to integrate physical laws directly into the learning process of a modified compartmental model. We also make use of the strength of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to combine data generated by a PINN and lagged covariates of target variables to forecast demand from the intensive care unit demand using different variations of RNN models. The results indicate that our proposed hybrid framework is highly effective in capturing the dynamics of the pandemic and providing insight into the dynamics of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MS) is a genetic disorder often associated with the development of aortic aneurysms, leading to severe vascular complications. The progression of this condition is intricately linked to hemodynamic factors such as wall shear stress (WSS) and von Mises stress, as abnormal distributions can contribute to thrombus formation, endothelial damage, and the worsening of aneurysmal conditions. In this study, six vascular models were analyzed: four representing diseased aortas with Marfan syndrome aneurysms and two healthy aortic models for comparison. The models were sourced from Vascular Model Repository, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted using a Newtonian fluid model and the shear stress transport (SST) k- ω turbulent transitional model to evaluate WSS and von Mises stress. Fluid-structure interaction was employed to incorporate vessel wall interaction, and pulsatile inlet velocity profiles were used to simulate physiological blood flow, capturing time-dependent hemodynamic variations. The results revealed significant differences between healthy and diseased aortic models. In healthy models, WSS was uniformly distributed, with values consistently below 40 Pa, reflecting stable vascular conditions. Conversely, the diseased models exhibited highly non-uniform WSS distributions, with notably lower values in aneurysmal regions, contributing to thrombus formation, with elevated WSS in areas like the carotid and subclavian arteries due to geometric and hemodynamic complexities. The von Mises stress analysis identified regions of heightened rupture risk, particularly on the superior side of case MS1, where both von Mises stress and WSS reached their highest values among all cases. Physics-informed neural networks demonstrated strong agreement with CFD results while significantly reducing computational cost, highlighting their potential for real-time clinical applications. These findings underscore the critical role of hemodynamic f",

      "abstract": "Objective: This paper aims to address the challenges in abstract screening within systematic reviews (SR) by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Methods: We employ LLM to prioritize candidate studies by aligning abstracts with the selection criteria outlined in an SR protocol. Abstract screening was transformed into a novel question-answering (QA) framework, treating each selection criterion as a question addressed by LLM. The framework involves breaking down the selection criteria into multiple questions, properly prompting LLM to answer each question, scoring and re-ranking each answer, and combining the responses to make nuanced inclusion or exclusion decisions.Results and Discussion: Large-scale validation was performed on the benchmark of CLEF eHealth 2019 Task 2: Technology-Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine. Focusing on GPT-3.5 as a case study, the proposed QA framework consistently exhibited a clear advantage over traditional information retrieval approaches and bespoke BERT-family models that were fine-tuned for prioritizing candidate studies (ie, from the BERT to PubMedBERT) across 31 datasets of 4 categories of SRs, underscoring their high potential in facilitating abstract screening. The experiments also showcased the viability of using selection criteria as a query for reference prioritization. The experiments also showcased the viability of the framework using different LLMs.Conclusion: Investigation justified the indispensable value of leveraging selection criteria to improve the performance of automated abstract screening. LLMs demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing candidate studies for abstract screening using the proposed QA framework. Significant performance improvements were obtained by re-ranking answers using the semantic alignment between abstracts and selection criteria. This further highlighted the pertinence of utilizing selection criteria to enhance abstract screening.",

Choosing the right sub-algorithm for a given problem is challenging: we hypothesise that Machine Learning can guide this sub-algorithm choice. A key consideration of our methodology is how to represent the mathematics to the ML model: we hypothesise that a representation which encodes the tree structure of mathematical expressions would be well suited. We trained both an LSTM and a TreeLSTM model for sub-algorithm prediction and compared them to Maple's existing approach. Our TreeLSTM performs much better than the LSTM, highlighting the benefit of using an informed representation of mathematical expressions.

      "abstract": "Applications of machine learning are becoming more prominent in the field of computer algebra. Examples of such applications include selecting S-pairs in Buchberger’s algorithm or solving integrals and differential equations directly. With many of these applications, data must be generated to train a model. Methods such as generating binary trees representing mathematical expressions or created randomly in a recursive manner from a set of available function symbols, variables and constants have been discussed. However, these generated expressions do not represent a realistic dataset that draws from the typical Maple user’s experience.I propose a framework for generating valid mathematical expressions. More precisely, the focus will be on integrable expressions. The difference from other methods lies in the fact that the data generation method will be based on a test suite of data generated from Maple users. Thus, the new synthetic data will have properties similar to integrable expressions that Maple users would typically try. This data generation method will be used to train machine learning models that make efficient choices algorithm selection problems.",

Assuming that the sequential data derives from the discretisation of the solution to an underlying PDE, the differential RBF network learns constant linear coefficients of the PDE, consequently regularising the RBF network by following modified backward-Euler updates. We experimentally validate the differential RBF network on the logistic map chaotic timeseries as well as on 30 real-world timeseries provided by Walmart in the M5 forecasting competition. The proposed model is compared with the normalised and unnormalised RBF networks, ARIMA, and ensembles of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks. From the experimental results, RBF-DiffNet consistently shows a marked reduction in the prediction error over the baseline RBF network (e.g., 41% reduction in the root mean squared scaled error on the M5 dataset, and 53% reduction in the mean absolute error on the logistic map); RBF-DiffNet also shows a comparable performance to the LSTM ensemble but requires 99% less computational time. Our proposed network consequently enables more accurate predictions—in the presence of observational noise—in sequence modelling tasks such as timeseries forecasting that leverage the model interpretability, fast training, and function approximation properties of the RBF network.",

Optimising these systems and their controllers might be possible with computationally efficient simulation. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art simulators are either too slow or provide little resolution of the cabin's thermal environment. In this work, we propose a novel approach to developing a fast simulation by machine learning (ML) from measurements within the car cabin over a number of trials within a climatic wind tunnel. A range of ML approaches are tried and compared. The best-performing ML approach is compared to more traditional 1D simulation in terms of accuracy and speed. The resulting simulation, based on Multivariate Linear Regression, is fast (5 microseconds per simulation second), and yields good accuracy (NRMSE 1.8%), which exceeds the performance of the traditional 1D simulator. Furthermore, the simulation is able to differentially simulate the thermal environment of the footwell versus the head and the driver position versus the front passenger seat, but unlike a traditional 1D model cannot support changes to the physical structure.This fast method for obtaining computationally efficient simulators of car cabins will accelerate adoption of techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning for climate control.",

Using the case of the design and deployment of 20 stove use monitors (SUM) in Kigeme refugee camp in Rwanda, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of collecting data on cookstove usage using wireless sensors in refugee settlements., Central to the discussion is the value of reflexivity or critical reflection to uncover significant knowledge gaps that can apply more generally to the problem of designing and deploying sensor systems for the displaced setting. If sensor monitoring systems are to collect data that aid appropriate energy planning and support technology development in the humanitarian sector, we contend improvements in sensor design and deployment protocols are needed to accommodate the displaced setting's cultural, economic, and political complexity.

The method is demonstrated for a case study plant in Bangalore, India, using onsite kitchen waste to provide biogas for cooking. The AD system is modelled using Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) and a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to control the substrate feeding rate in order to simultaneously minimise the volume of flared biogas, unmet gas demand and energy cost. Our results show that ADM1 can predict biogas yield from a continuously operated digester well with mean percentage error between daily predicted and measured data values of only 5.7% for March 2017 and 17.8% for July 2017. When biogas flaring and unmet gas demand were minimised, the amount of biogas flared reduced from 886.62 m3to 88.87 m3in March and from 73.79 m3to 68.49 m3in July. When the energy cost was also considered within an objective function, the biogas flared reduced from 886.62 m3to 281.27 m3for March, but increased from 73.79 m3to 180.11 m3for July. The amount of flaring increased in July as the energy cost function increased biogas yield without considering surplus gas production beyond demand and storage capacity. As AD systems are often operated to maximise biogas production, these results highlight the need for multi-objective optimisation, particularly for off-grid AD systems.",

Available comfort models are already used to correlate thermal comfort to influencing factors.

OBJECTIVE: This publication investigates the impact of fragrances with “warm” and “cold” associated meanings on thermal and overall comfort perception. METHODS: Human subject trials (n = 47) were performed in different temperature-controlled environments following a 3×3 within-subject design considering ambient fragrance (“neutral scent”, “peppermint”, “orange & cinnamon”) and ambient light as variables. RESULTS: Olfactory comfort is shown to have the larger effect on overall comfort perception, comparable in weight to the one of thermal comfort. The impact observed on thermal sensation was in line with the meanings associated the fragrances, whereas it was positive on thermal comfort appreciation regardless of the type of fragrance diffused. CONCLUSIONS: These initial results suggest that olfactory stimulations have the potential to positively impact thermal and overall comfort. The appreciation of the fragrance appears to have a major impact on these interactions and should be deeply considered in future research and features development.",

The faulty measurement is on the pitch angle.A jump Markov regularized particle filter is proposed for fault and state estimation of the nonlinear aircraft dynamics, with a Markovian jump strategy to manage the probabilistic transitions between the fault free and faulty modes. The jump strategy uses a small number of sentinel particles to continue testing the alternate hypothesis under both fault free and faulty modes. The proposed filter is shown to outperform the regularized particle filter for this application in terms of fault estimation accuracy and convergence time for scenarios involving both abrupt and incipient faults, without prior knowledge of the fault models. The state estimation is also more accurate and robust to faults using the proposed approach. The root-mean-square error for the altitude is reduced by 77% using the jump Markov regularized particle filter under a pitch sensor fault amplitude of up to 10 degrees. Performance enhancement compared to the regularized particle filter was found to be more pronounced when fault amplitudes increase.",

As research has typically focused on optimising the digester and its associated parameters to maximise the biogas yield; this research examines how different objectives can influence how one might want to control the system. The system is initially modelled and validated with measured data and an optimisation algorithm is then applied to control the feedstock flow rate. The results show that the performance of first order AD models, in predicting the biogas yield, only differs from measured data by 9% and that by controlling the feeding rate, the amount of flared biogas and unmet cooking demand can be reduced by 100% and approximately 87%, respectively when they are the only objective functions considered. If the energy cost is also added an objective function, then more precise control of feeding rate is needed to ensure that all three conflicting objectives are equally minimised. This result highlights the importance of using the correct feeding rate in the system and considering the overall system during optimisation as producing more biogas might not result in the most cost-effectivesystem.",

Thermal comfort is particularly important in this context as it affects how well students learn in the classroom. This study aims to identify comfort temperature ranges in different classroom types, lecture rooms, studios and PC labs in UK higher learning environments. Overall, more than 3,000 university students in Coventry and Edinburgh were observed and surveyed simultaneously with the monitoring of environmental measurements under free-running, cooling and heating modes, in October and November 2017 and January to March 2018. Thermal comfort zones and comfort temperatures were identified in each classroom type under these three operation modes. The thermal comfort zone was shown to be significantly dependant on the operative temperature in the studios and PC labs. In terms of the students’ priorities for adaptive behaviour inside the classrooms, students in the lecture rooms and PC labs with lower levels of freedom, preferred to restore their thermal comfort through personal adaptive behaviour. However, environmental behaviour was shown to be preferred in the studios where the occupants have a greater freedom level. Results indicate a higher level of physiological and psychological thermal adaptation for the occupants of the studios and PC labs compared to those in the lecture rooms. Consequently, the type of classroom and the students’ freedom levels should be considered in environmental design of higher education buildings.",

This investigation was conducted at eight mixed-mode university buildings in United Kingdom whose occupants had diverse thermal histories. The research design consisted of simultaneous environmental measurements, a questionnaire survey and observation on 3,452 students performing sedentary activities in the classrooms. To eliminate the influence of acclimatisation in the UK, a subset of 1,225 students with less than 3 years of residence in the UK were selected as the survey sample. Students‘ thermal comfort responses were categorised into three main groups based on their climatic background compared to the UK (warmer, similar and cooler climatic background groups). Data was statistically analysed to derive the thermal comfort requirements of each climatic group based on reported thermal sensations, preferences, acceptability and comfort votes. The findings confirm the influence of long-term thermal history on thermal sensation, thermal comfort zone, acceptability, preference and comfort temperature (neutrality). There was generally no difference in the subjective thermal comfort of the students with similar climatic backgrounds to the UK and those from cooler climates than the UK. However, significant differences appeared between the warmer thermal history group and the other two groups. It was also demonstrated that the participants with a warmer thermal history had cooler thermal sensations compared to their counterparts in the similar-to and colder-than-UK thermal history groups, when exposed to the same environments. The optimal acceptable temperature was higher for the warmer climatic background (24°C) than the similar/cooler climatic background groups (22°C).

Space heating, which is the largest and most expensive part of the energy used in the UK educational buildings is a potential target for improving energy efficiency. However, the role of thermal comfort in students' productivity in academic environments cannot be overlooked. Considering the prevalence of two different climatic conditions in Northern and Southern/Midland regions of the UK, this study investigated thermal comfort in two university campuses in Scotland and England. environmental measurements combined with a simultaneous questionnaire survey were conducted in eight university buildings in Edinburgh and Coventry. The field study was carried out during the academic year of 2017-18 on 3507 students. The results confirmed influence of students' acclimatization, showing a warmer than neutral mean Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV) and cooler thermal preference in Edinburgh than Coventry. The higher acceptable temperature in Coventry (23.5 °C) than Edinburgh (22.1 °C) reinforced the results on the influence of climatic adaptation. Thermal acceptability was examined in a direct (analysing the actual votes on thermal acceptability) and an indirect approach (considering the TSV between −1 and 1 as acceptable). The indirect approach was shown to be a better predictor of the thermal acceptability as this method extends beyond the acceptable range suggested by the direct method. Thermal perceptions of females were shown to be colder than males in university classrooms. However, no statistically significant difference was observed in the thermal comfort of different age groups.",

We identify the fuel choice determinants in these communities using a multinomial logistic regression model and more generally discuss the validity and robustness of such models in the context of statistical validation and evaluation metrics. Specifically for the Amazonas communities considered in this study, the research showed that the fuel choice determinants are the age of household, the number of people at meals each day, the number of meals daily, the community, education of the household head, and the income level of the household. Moreover, given the Brazilian policies related to energy and sustainability, this region is not likely to reach the Sustainable Development Goals proposed by United Nations for 2030.",

      "abstract": "The first stage in any control system is to be able to accurately estimate the system’s state. However, some types of measurements are ambiguous (non-injective) in terms of state. Existing algorithms for such problems, such as Monte Carlo methods, are computationally expensive or not robust to such ambiguity. We propose the Box Regularized Particle Filter (BRPF) to resolve these problems. Based on previous works on box particle filters, we present a more generic and accurate formulation of the algorithm, with two innovations: a generalized box resampling step and a kernel smoothing method, which is shown to be optimal in terms of Mean Integrated Square Error. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the efficiency of BRPF on a severely ambiguous and non-linear estimation problem, that of Terrain Aided Navigation. BRPF is compared to the Sequential Importance Resampling Particle Filter (SIR-PF), Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC), and the original Box Particle Filter (BPF). The algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of Root Mean Square Error (e.g., improvement up to 42% in geographical position estimation with respect to the BPF) for a large initial uncertainty. The BRPF reduces the computational load by 73%and 90% for SIR-PF and MCMC, respectively, with similar RMSE values. This work offers an accurate (in terms of RMSE) and robust (in terms of divergence rate) way to tackle state estimation from ambiguous measurements while requiring a significantly lower computational load than classic Monte Carlo and particle filtering methods.",

Using the same optimality conditions, we then derive a dynamic Bayes optimal linear classifier for heteroscedastic LDA that is optimised via an efficient iterative procedure, which is robust against class imbalance. Experimental work is conducted on two artificial and eight real-world datasets. Our results show that the proposed algorithm compares favourably with the existing heteroscedastic LDA procedures as well as the linear support vector machine (SVM) in terms of the error rate, but is superior to all the algorithms in terms of the AUC under class imbalance. The fast training time of the proposed algorithm also encourages its use for large-data applications that show high incidence of class imbalance, such as in human activity recognition.",

These approaches, however, sometimes reduce the rate so substantially as to make the health state of the network opaque. One solution is to include a regular heartbeat transmission whose receipt or otherwise informs the sink about the health state of the node. However, given that a large period increases the probability that dead nodes go unnoticed at the sink, while a small period likely increases the energy cost of communication, what should be the period of the heartbeat transmission? In this paper, we examine the use of heartbeats in WSN design. We derive a general protocol for optimal and dynamic heartbeat transmission by minimising the Bayes risk, which is the expected cost of missing data from dead nodes plus the energy cost of heartbeat transmissions. Our proposed algorithm is dynamic in the sense that the heartbeat period is updated as time goes on and node failures become more probable. We validate our design experimentally using three real-world datasets, and show a 36% reduction in the total heartbeat operational cost over a heartbeat transmission with a fixed period; the results also highlight the superiority of our algorithm over arbitrarily chosen heartbeat periods in different WSN settings, thus promising significant cost savings in WSN applications.",

      "abstract": "Accurate metering of slug flows is important in many industries that handle multiphase products. For the oil and gas industry the harsh environmental conditions mean that non-invasive and non-intrusive instruments are preferred. Cross-correlation meters, particularly those based on electrical tomography, offer a potential solution to this problem but sufficient accuracy has proved difficult to achieve, with the primary issue being that the measurement is dominated by the motion of interfaces rather than the bulk fluid. In the work reported here, results are presented for flows of oil and nitrogen gas in a horizontal pipe of diameter 10.2 cm. Superficial velocities of liquid and gas range from 1 m/s to 3 m/s and 0.4–3 m/s respectively. By analysing the structures of liquid slugs via tomography, it is found that three significantly different slug front structures occur. The high-speed and spatial resolution of Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) enables independent measurement of individual slug fronts and tail as well as average slug velocity. Based on detailed measurements of slug structures and velocity profiles, we go on to show that using differential-based cross-correlation and the average velocity of slug front and tail, an overall accuracy of better than +/−5% is achieved for estimation of the mixture superficial velocity. This is an equivalent level of accuracy to that obtained using intrusive methods such as optical fibre probes, which are less suitable for oil and gas applications.",

Aligning the segment with the fall stageis difficult, as the segment size varies.

To evaluate our approach, twopublicly accessible datasets wereused. Classification and regression tree (CART),k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), logistic regression (LR),and the support vector machine (SVM) were used totrain the classifiers. EvenT-ML gives classifierF-scores of 98% for a chest-worn sensor and92% for a waist-worn sensor, and significantlyreduces the computational cost compared with theFNSW- and FOSW-based approaches, with reductions ofup to 8-fold and 78-fold, respectively.

Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of BPC, which ensures the constraints satisfaction even for low numbers of box particles.

This paper highlights that ‘Context’, ‘Occupant’, and ‘Building’ (COB) have the most influence on adaptive behaviours. However, in most cases their influence is not considered holistically.

In the context of several vehicles flying in formation, navigation accuracy can be enhanced by communication between the vehicles.

An absolute navigation filter provides a first estimate of the navigation solution, while a relative observer rebuilds the neighbors relative states from embedded seekers. A high-level Master Filter fuses information provided by those two low-level filters to enhance the navigation solution. Absolute navigation measurements are terrain elevation data correlated with a Digital Elevation Model map. Since they are highly ambiguous and nonlinear, they are processed by a Box Regularized Particle Filter. The relative measurements under consideration suffer a high level of uncertainty, especially on the relative distance between vehicles. By fusing all uncertain data, a complete and accurate navigation solution is obtained. Numerical results are presented and show an enhancement in navigation performance by exchanging information, in terms of RMS estimation error (63% more accurate in position), estimation confidence (78% more precise in position), and computational load (requires 83% less operations).",

      "abstract": "Supervised linear dimensionality reduction (LDR) performed prior to classification often improves the accuracy of classification by reducing overfitting and removing multicollinearity. If a Bayes classifier is to be used, then reduction to a dimensionality of $K-1$ is necessary and sufficient to preserve the classification information in the original feature space for the $K$-class problem. However, most of the existing algorithms provide no optimal dimensionality to which to reduce the data, thus classification information can be lost in the reduced space if $K-1$ dimensions are used. In this paper, we present a novel LDR technique to reduce the dimensionality of the original data to $K-1$, such that it is well-primed for Bayesian classification. This is done by sequentially constructing linear classifiers that minimise the Bayes error via a gradient descent procedure, under an assumption of normality. We experimentally validate the proposed algorithm on $10$ UCI datasets. Our algorithm is shown to be superior in terms of the classification accuracy when compared to existing algorithms including LDR based on Fisher's criterion and the Chernoff criterion. The applicability of our algorithm is then demonstrated by employing it in diagnosing the health states of $2$ ultrasonic flow meters. As with the UCI datasets, the proposed algorithm is found to have superior performance to the existing algorithms, achieving classification accuracies of $99.4\\%$ and $97.5\\%$ on the two flow meters. Such high classification accuracies on the flow meters promise significant cost benefits in oil and gas operations.NOTICE: this is the author’s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Expert Systems with Applications.

For uncontrolled environments, such as a greenhouse solar dryer, a product's drying time varies depending on ambient conditions and is thus more difficult to predict. Prediction of the drying time is needed to better schedule dryer use. Data was obtained from a set of wireless scales that weigh the waste during solar drying after initial moisture content measurement of a sample. A set of linear and quadratic models for drying rate are tested with the best yielding a 39% reduction in RMSE over traditional models. The results indicate that the modelling approach is likely to be useful for open solar dryers where the temperature, and thus the drying rate, is not controlled.",

However, current systems control temperature rather than thermal comfort and tend to be energy hungry, which is of particular concern when considering electric vehicles. This paper poses energy-efficient vehicle comfort control as a Markov Decision Process, which is then solved numerically using Sarsa(λ) and an empirically validated, single-zone, 1D thermal model of the cabin. The resulting controller was tested in simulation using 200 randomly selected scenarios and found to exceed the performance of bang-bang, proportional, simple fuzzy logic, and commercial controllers with 23%, 43%, 40%, 56% increase, respectively. Compared to the next best performing controller, energy consumption is reduced by 13% while the proportion of time spent thermally comfortable is increased by 23%. These results indicate that this is a viable approach that promises to translate into substantial comfort and energy improvements in the car.",

To improve the performance of LDA, heteroscedastic LDA (HLDA) that removes the equal covariance assumption has been developed. In this paper, we show that the existing approaches either have no principled computational procedure for optimal parameter selection, or underperform in terms of the accuracy of classification and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) under class imbalance. We then derive a Bayes optimal linear classifier for heteroscedastic LDA that is robust against class imbalance and is obtained via an efficient gradient descent optimisation procedure. Our experimental work on one artificial dataset shows that our proposed algorithm achieves the minimum misclassification rate as compared to existing HLDA approaches if the errors in both the minority and majority classes are of equal importance. In the scenario where the errors in the minority class may be of more importance, further experiments on five real-world datasets show the superiority of our algorithm in terms of the AUC as compared to the original LDA procedure, existing HLDA algorithms, and the linear support vector machine (SVM).",

In the heteroscedastic case, LDA is not guaranteed to minimise this error. Assuming heteroscedasticity, we derive a linear classifier, the Gaussian Linear Discriminant (GLD), that directly minimises the Bayes error for binary classification. In addition, we also propose a local neighbourhood search (LNS) algorithm to obtain a more robust classifier if the data is known to have a non-normal distribution. We evaluate the proposed classifiers on two artificial and ten real-world datasets that cut across a wide range of application areas including handwriting recognition, medical diagnosis and remote sensing, and then compare our algorithm against existing LDA approaches and other linear classifiers. The GLD is shown to outperform the original LDA procedure in terms of the classification accuracy under heteroscedasticity. While it compares favourably with other existing heteroscedastic LDA approaches, the GLD requires as much as 60 times lower training time on some datasets. Our comparison with the support vector machine (SVM) also shows that, the GLD, together with the LNS, requires as much as 150 times lower training time to achieve an equivalent classification accuracy on some of the datasets. Thus, our algorithms can provide a cheap and reliable option for classification in a lot of expert systems.",

We examine experiences of tuning the energy profile for two near-production wireless sensor systems and demonstrate the need for (a) microbenchmark-based energy consumption profiling, (b) examining start-up costs, and (c) monitoring the nodes during long-term deployments. The tuning exercise resulted in reductions in energy consumption of a) 93% for a multihop Telos-based system (average power 0.029 mW) b) 94.7% for a single hop Ti- 8051-based system during startup, and c) 39% for a Ti- 8051 system post start-up. The work reported shows that reducing the energy consumption of a node requires a whole system view, not just measurement of a “typical” sensing cycle.

While the TS approach can yield superior performance, it involves a high computational complexity. Moreover, the difficulty in parameter selection in the existing TS approach does not make it any more attractive. This paper presents an alternative, low-complexity formulation of the TS optimization procedure for K-Means clustering. This approach does not require many parameter settings. We initially constrain the centers to points in the dataset. We then aim at evolving these centers using a unique neighborhood structure that makes use of gradient information of the objective function. This results in an efficient exploration of the search space, after which the means are refined. The proposed scheme is implemented in MATLAB and tested on four real-world datasets, and it achieves a significant improvement over the existing TS approach in terms of the intra cluster sum of squares and computational time.",

To examine this approach, accelerometer data from 48 subjects performing a combination of falls and ordinary behaviour is used to train 3 types of classifier (J48 Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron).

Four types of falls (forward, backward, lateral left and right) and several ADL were simulated. This data set is intended for the evaluation of fall detection al- gorithms by combining daily activities and transitions from one posture to another with falls.

The solutions presented use non-default platform features in order to solve the issues of i) high power consumption on node startup due to network discovery and joining and ii) high power consumption of application level acknowledgements. The startup power consumption was reduced by 94.7%, while the cost of a sense-process-transmit-acknowledge cycle was reduced by 38.6%.

Estimating and controlling vehicle occupant thermal comfort is therefore a challenging task. This paper focuses on evaluating the suitability of four existing thermal comfort models, namely the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), Taniguchi's model, Zhang's model and Nilsson's model in a variety of car cabin conditions. A series of comfort trials were performed ranging from controlled indoor trials to on-road driving trials. The outputs of all four models were compared to the sensation index reported by the subjects situated in the driver seat. The results show that PMV and Nilsson's model are generally applicable for the car cabin environment, but that they are most accurate when there is a small air temperature rate of change (of under 1.5 °C per minute), giving correlation levels of 0.91 and 0.93 for the two models respectively. Taniguchi's and Zhang's models were found unsuitable for all conditions, with correlation levels ranging between 0.03 and 0.60. Nilsson's model is recommended by the authors based on the level of agreement with the subjective reports, its ability to estimate both local and overall thermal sensation and the smaller number of input parameters.",

However, direct measurement of this parameter is impractical in fielded applications. The paper presents an empirical, multiple linear regression based approach for estimating body segment equivalent temperatures for car cabin occupants from different sensors within the car. Body part equivalent temperature at eight segments and cabin sensor data (air temperature, surface temperature, mean radiant temperature, humidity and solar load) was gathered in a variety of environmental and cabin conditions. 38 experimental hours of trials in a controlled environment and 26 experimental hours of realistic driving trials were used for training and evaluating the estimator's performance. The estimation errors were on average between 0.5°C and 1.9°C for different body parts for trials within a controlled environment, while for trials in realistic driving scenarios they ranged between 1°C and 2°C. This demonstrates that passenger body part equivalent temperature can be estimated using a multiple linear regression from environmental sensors and leads the way to comfort driven Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning control.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the benefits of edge mining – data mining that takes place on the wireless, battery-powered smart sensing devices that sit at the edge points of the Internet of Things. Through local data reduction and transformation, edge mining can quantifiably reduce the number of packets that must be sent, reducing energy usage and remote storage requirements. Additionally, edge mining has the potential to reduce the risk to personal privacy through embedding of information requirements at the sensing point, limiting inappropriate use. The benefits of edge mining are examined with respect to three specific algorithms: Linear Spanish Inquisition Protocol (L-SIP), ClassAct, and Bare Necessities (BN), which are all instantiations of the General SIP (G-SIP). In general, the benefits provided by edge mining are related to the predictability of data streams and availability of precise information requirements; results show that L-SIP typically reduces packet transmission by around 95% (20-fold), BN reduces packet transmission by 99.98% (5000-fold) and ClassAct reduces packet transmission by 99.6% (250-fold). Although energy reduction is not as radical due to other overheads, minimisation of these overheads can lead to up to a 10-fold battery life extension for L-SIP, for example. These results demonstrate the importance of edge mining to the feasibility of many IoT applications.",

This paper reports and reflects on two algorithms which i) improve the accuracy of real-time, multi-accelerometer based posture classifiers when dealing with natural movement and transitions and ii) maximize a wearable system's battery life through distributed computation at nodes. The EWV transition filters proposed here increase the classification accuracy by 1% over unfiltered results in realistic scenarios and significantly reduces spurious classifier output in real-time visualizations. A 200 fold transmission reduction from the on-body system to an outside system was achieved in practice by combining the transition filters with an event-based design. Furthermore, a method of reducing transmissions between on-body data gathering nodes based on distributed processing of the classifier rules (but maintaining a one-way flow of communications during system use) is also described. This provides a 3.3 fold reduction in packets and a 13.5 fold reduction in data transmitted from one node to the other in a two-node wearable system.",

The work focuses on Explosive Ordnance Disposal operatives and shows that predictions of UHS risk can be performed in real-time with sufficient accuracy for real-world use. Furthermore, it is shown that the required sensory input for such algorithms can be obtained with wearable, non-intrusive sensors. Two algorithms, one based on Bayesian nets and another on decision trees, are presented for determining the heat stress risk, considering the mean skin temperature prediction as a proxy. The algorithms are trained on empirical data and have accuracies of 92.1 ± 2.9% and 94.4 ± 2.1%, respectively when tested using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. In applications such as Explosive Ordnance Disposal operative monitoring, such prediction algorithms can enable autonomous actuation of cooling systems and haptic alerts to minimise casualties.",

The algorithm learns the monitored subject's behaviour autonomously post-deployment and provides time-suppressed summaries of the activity types engaged with by the subject over the course of their day to day life. It transmits updates to external observers only when the summary changes by more than a defined threshold. This technique substantially reduces the number of transmission required by a wearable monitoring system, both through summarisation of the raw data into useful information and by preventing transmission of duplicated or predictable data and information. Based on evaluation using simulated activity data, the proposed algorithm results in an average of one transmission per month following an initial convergence period (reaching less than 1 transmission per day after only three days) and detects a change in behaviour after an average of 1.1 days.",

      "abstract": "Energy, both in terms of its production and its usage has occupied a prime place in research as well as politics and world economy for the past few years. The majority of nations are aiming to deliver severe carbon cuts in the next few years. However, achieving a carbon-free future needs more than infrastructure investment and novel efficient technologies for buildings, transportation and other large consumer domains. It needs a better understanding of people as consumers, as well as a better understanding of energy waste across the multitude of socio-techical systems around us. With regards to the built environment and particularly residential buildings, the authors propose that dual, quantitative and qualitative approaches to characterising, assessing and improving occupied buildings are necessary. Such approaches would synchronously cater for understanding i) buildings technical performance (fabric and building heating, cooling and ventilation systems) and ii) occupant's motivation, ability, knowledge and efficacy for adopting low carbon lifestyles. When deployed at scale, the above will enable cost effective, targeted interventions for both building fabric and systems improvement and towards empowering their occupants to live sustainably. The paper describes such a quantitative and qualitative approach and proposes assessment tools. Further, the authors comment on the potential benefits from monitoring campaigns when deployed at scale.",

Although many low-level platform-oriented energy saving mechanisms have been developed, considerable savings are possible at application level. This work presents an approach to pushing the calculation of application-level state closer to the information source. The context in which this approach is evaluated is a residential building monitoring application. Combined with the Spanish Inquisition Protocol (SIP), this is shown, based on deployment data, to reduce the average transmission period for temperature data from once every 5 minutes to an average of once every 38 days for an allowed error threshold of 10% on any component of the application-level state. For combined sensing of temperature, relative humidity and CO2, the average transmission period drops to 13 days. This transmission reduction should considerably extend network life while having minimal effect on the usefulness of the information gathered. Most importantly, the underlying approach generalises to a wide variety of applications.",

      "abstract": "Following more than a decade of intensive research work, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are commonly acknowledged today as proven research instruments for several application domains. In particular, they have made notable contributions to the understanding of our natural environment and habitats (through detailed monitoring of glaciers, forests, rivers and volcanoes). WSNs strengths are derived from their ability to unveil spatio-temporal patterns and thus enable both global and detailed interpretation of complex environmental phenomena. The built environment has been, till recently, one of the least explored application domains for WSNs, in spite of their obvious suitability: i.e low data rates, friendly deployment environment, physical sensors availability, mains power for servers, energy harvesting opportunities (solar) for sensors powering. The authors will share findings and work towards holistic performance metrics based on 11 data sets obtained during a total of 2.5 years of deployed monitoring in 10 homes (with an average of 50 sensors per home). The homes exhibited large variations in their energy and environmental performance, were heated by a variety of mechanical systems and occupied by several family archetypes.",

      "abstract": "Car cabins are transient, non-uniform thermal environments, both with respect to time and space. Identifying representative locations for the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system sensors is an open research problem. Common sensor positioning approaches are driven by considerations such as cost or aesthetics, which may impact on the performance/outputs of the HVAC system and thus occupants’ comfort. Based on experimental data, this paper quantifies the spacial-temporal variations in the cabin’s environment by using Mutual Information (MI) as a similarity measure. The overarching aim for the work is to find optimal (but practical) locations for sensors that: i) can produce accurate estimates of temperature at locations where sensors would be difficult to place, such as on an occupant’s face or abdomen and ii) thus, support the development of occupant rather than cabin focused HVAC control algorithms. When applied to experimental data from stable and hot/cold soaking scenarios, the method proposed successfully identified practical sensor locations which estimate face and abdomen temperatures of an occupant with less than 0.7°C and 0.5°C error, respectively.",

Excellent economies of scale (natural requirement for geographically distributed deployments with thousands (millions?) of instances). 2. Strong political drive (global warming and climate change drivers; zero carbon regulations, decent homes standards). 3. Very large end-user scale (nearly 70% of the average household utility bill could be influenced by WSN-based energy and environmental monitoring).

SIP's key advancement is that it transmits a state vector estimate rather than individual readings. SIP can be tuned according to the desired estimate accuracy, with lower desired accuracy typically leading to fewer transmitted packets. In simulation with real data, less than 5% of the samples needed to be transmitted to provide the sink with an accurate estimate of the sensor value (within 0.5°C, in the case of temperature). SIP also significantly outperforms prior DPS results when using the same data sets. In deployment on Telos motes, SIP shows similar performance to the simulations.",

The combination of the heavy (roughly 40kg) suit, physical exertion, and the environment in which these suits are worn can cause the wearer's temperature to rise to uncomfortable and potentially dangerous levels during missions. This paper reports on the development of a wearable wireless sensing system suitable for deployment in such manned bomb disposal missions. In its final form, the system will be capable of making in-network autonomous decisions related to the actuation of cooling within the suit, in order to increase the comfort of the wearer. In addition, it will allow an external observer to remotely monitor the health and comfort of the operative. Laboratory experiments with the instrumented suit show how skin temperature varies differently for different skin sites, motivating the need for multiple, distributed sensing. The need for timely application of in-suit cooling is also shown, as well as the importance of monitoring the overall health of the wearer of the suit. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

      "abstract": "The fundamental aim of monitoring is to identify abnormalities in the observed phenomena and allow inference of the likely cause. Faced with the common problems of spatially irregular sensor distribution and intermittent sensor measurement availability, key to fulfilling the monitoring aim is filling in the spatiotemporal gaps in the data. While wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technology, combined with microelectromechanical systems availability potentially offer sensing solutions for a variety of application domains, in the context of monitoring applications a conceptual shift is needed from currently available, point-measurement-based ldquosense-and-sendrdquo systems toward the provision of phenomena field representations, in real time, enabling effective visualization of the spatiotemporal patterns. This paper argues the case for a generic, rapid prototyping framework for end-to-end sensing systems that support the approach of providing field representations for visualization. A formal approach to framework development was taken, ensuring that resulting instrumentation systems are well specified. Both the framework development and its evaluation are linked to the full cycle of requirements setting, design, and deployment of a prototype instrumentation system for aerospace applications-specifically, health monitoring of a gas turbine engine. The field monitoring application prototyping (FieldMAP) framework supports multimodal sensing, provides a number of opportunities for data processing and information extraction, caters for monitoring of the instrumentation health, offers a modular field-mapping design component and allows for real-time phenomena visualization, data and information logging, and postanalysis. Experience with the FieldMAP has shown that sophisticated and robust prototypes can be developed in a short period of time.",

      "abstract": "During manned bomb disposal missions, the combination of the protective suit's weight (37 kg), physical activity, high ambient temperatures, and restricted airflow can cause the operative's temperature to rise to dangerous levels during missions, impairing their physical and mental ability. This work proposes to use body sensor networks (BSNs) to increase the safety of operatives in such missions through detailed physiological monitoring, fusion of health information, and remote alerts. Previous trials conducted by the authors have shown no correlation between the suit wearer's temperature at any single skin site and their core temperature, nor between single-point temperature variations and subjective thermal sensation. This paper reports on the development of a wearable, wireless, networked sensing system suitable for integration within the suit and deployment in manned missions. A sensor fusion and modeling approach is proposed that estimates the overall thermal sensation of the suit wearer, in real time, based on the multipoint temperature data. Zhang's thermal sensation model was used in this work. Modeling is performed locally to enable cooling system actuation, provide local feedback, and accommodate application specific constraints. Experimentation with the prototype confirms the importance of multisite skin measurement, timely cooling actuation, and monitoring the operative's thermal state. Evaluation of Zhang's model highlights the need for a bespoke model to account for suit and mission specific factors. The deployed BSN has been evaluated through experimental trials using a number of subjects in mission-like conditions and has been shown to be appropriate for the target application.",

The prototype acts as a concept demonstrator for the application at hand. Building upon the state of the art in the domain, the authors pursued a rapid prototyping approach, supported by a base prototyping framework - FieldMAP. As a key property, the framework enables the conceptual shift from data to user relevant information. Consequently, an information extraction and visualisation component is put forward as an addition to traditional “sense and send” WSN systems. The component offers an intuitive approach to user understanding of the global evolution of the observed phenomena. Integrated within the prototype, this component makes use of the processing power available within the WSN coupled with interpolation algorithms borrowed from the geosciences domain. Reconstruction of field representations of the phenomena from the sparse sensed data allows identification of abnormalities and inference of their likely cause.",

Several research groups world wide have engaged with the development of low-power wireless body sensor networks that are capable of providing real-time posture tracking for a variety of applications, such as dance and sports. The work reported here is concerned with the development of a wireless body sensor network that, as opposed to posture tracking, can: a) provide the identification and classification of eight human postures (standing, kneeling, sitting, crawling, walking, laying down on front and back, and laying on one side) in real-time and b) is able to relate this information wirelessly to a remote monitoring point. Posture information is an essential part of monitoring operatives in safety critical missions. The work sits within a larger project aiming to increase general safety of operatives in bomb disposal missions. The goal of the posture body sensor network developed here is to identify the eight named postures using data from nine accelerometers placed at various sites on the human body. A prototype implementation which fulfills the goal has been produced and evaluated and is reported.",

The conflicting measurement system requirements of low weight and detailed, high rate, robust, multipoint measurement can be mitigated through the use of wire-less instrumentation. This technical report describes a prototype system that explores the use of multiple wirelessly networked sensors to deliver detailed spatial-temporal flow temperature information to enable CBM and enhance informational output from engine testing.",

      "abstract": "Rolls-Royce are pioneers in the concept of “power-by-the-hour”, whereby they no longer sell gas turbine engines and leave maintenance and spare parts costs to the customer but rather sell a service agreement to provide thrust on an hours of use basis. This approach has reoriented engine manufacturers from selling spare parts to trying to maximise each engine’s longevity. This reorientation has introduced a new emphasis on sensing and monitoring. An example is the temperature sensors harness developed by Vibro Meter UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of Meggit Plc. Their thermocouple probes are able to withstand the high temperatures found within the gas stream. In principle, the large number of thermocouple sensors mounted within the engine could provide detailed thermal maps and thus provide for accurate diagnosis of potential problems before they occur. A difficulty, however, is that sending all the individual sensor data back to the control unit would require a large amount of heavy duty cabling, thus significantly increasing the weight of the engine. To avoid this, sensor values are averaged, and only a single cable is used. Even a single cable may be more than is necessary, however. By making use of wireless technology, low-power electronics, and advanced visualisation techniques researchers at Coventry University’s Cogent Computing Applied Research Centre (CCARC), are developing a system to wirelessly connect the high temperature thermocouples and perhaps other sensors on the gas turbine engine. Furthermore, they are looking at developing visualisation tools to ensure that the much more detailed gathered data can be easily interpreted. It is hoped that the development of such a wireless sensing system will lead to several important benefits: it will reduce the weight of the engine; it will allow a detailed map of temperatures within the gas flow of the engine to be obtained; it will allow sensor faults to be detected more readily.",

Based on a distributed manufacturing paradigm (Holonic Component Based Architecture -HCBA), it proposes the functions and interfaces the new machine and the existing manufacturing system should possess, so that ready and simple configuration of additional machines into an existing manufacturing system (plug and play) can be achieved. The configuration process is intended to include not only mechanical and electrical interfaces, but also decision system interfaces (such as planning, scheduling and shop floor control) too.",

      "year": "2007",
      "abstract": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology is receiving considerable attention as an enabling technology that can improve supply chain asset tracking and inventory control. RFID is an automatic identification technology whereby digital data encoded in a transponder is captured by a reader using radio waves. The communication process between the transponder and the reader involves the transmitting of energy by the reader's antenna, which is picked up by transponder's antenna and some of it reflected back using backscattering modulation. Nonetheless RFID is still a relatively immature technology and many of its characteristics in real-life industrial scenarios are not yet fully understood. For example, the performance of RFID can be severely hampered by the presence of metals and liquids in the tagged product or extreme conditions in the environment. Hence it is important to examine the practical feasibility of RFID in harsher surroundings. This research is an attempt to examine the practical issues associated with using RFID in a complex metal environment and the interference of RF waves caused by metals in particular. The work also highlights various methods which when applied can improve the performance of RFID significantly",

      "abstract": "PetriLLD is a graphical development environment that allows the user to construct and test control programs for discrete event systems. The graphical language is a simple form of Petri net with some notational changes that allow it to express sensory input. Once the Petri net is designed and tested, it can be output in a number of different forms, including PLC (programmable logic controller) ladder logic diagrams, and various high-level languages including Java and Visual Basic. The main features of this tool are the ability to rapidly construct sophisticated control systems that include a large amount of distributed and concurrent behavior; the ability to compile to both general purpose computer and PLC forms; and the ability to separate the description of the behaviour from the implementation instance. This tutorial is intended to guide the user through their first use of the tool. It has been written with version 1.1 (build 20060917) in mind, so if you have an earlier version, you might like to start by going through the installation section and installing the latest version.",

      "abstract": "The obnoxious p-median problem is a facility location problem where we maximise the sum of the distances between each client point and its nearest facility. Since it is nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard, most algorithms designed for the problem follow metaheuristic strategies to find high-quality solutions in affordable time but with no optimality guarantee. In this paper, a variant of the iterated greedy algorithm is developed for the problem. It adopts the idea of increasing the search radius used in variable neighbourhood search by increasing the number of reconstructed components at each iteration with no improved solution, where the amount of the increase is determined dynamically based on the quality of the current solution. We demonstrate that the new algorithm significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms for this problem on standard datasets.",

      "abstract": "This paper builds and extends on the authors' previous work related to the algorithmic tool, Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD), and one of its core applications, Real Quantifier Elimination (QE). These topics are at the heart of symbolic computation and were first implemented in computer algebra systems decades ago, but have recently received renewed interest as part of the ongoing development of SMT solvers for non-linear real arithmetic.First, we consider the use of iterated univariate resultants in traditional CAD, and how this leads to inefficiencies, especially in the case of an input with multiple equational constraints. We reproduce the workshop paper [Davenport & England, 2023], adding important clarifications to our suggestions first made there to make use of multivariate resultants in the projection phase of CAD. We then consider an alternative approach to this problem first documented in [McCallum & Brown, 2009] which redefines the actual object under construction, albeit only in the case of two equational constraints. We correct an unhelpful typo and provide a proof missing from that paper.We finish by revising the topic of how to deal with SMT or Real QE problems expressed using rational functions (as opposed to the usual polynomial ones) noting that these are often found in industrial applications. We revisit a proposal made in [Uncu, Davenport and England, 2023] for doing this in the case of satisfiability, explaining why such an approach does not trivially extend to more complicated quantification structure and giving a suitable alternative.",

We investigate whether synthetic data generation can help identify at-risk students earlier in a small, imbalanced dataset from an introductory programming module. The analysis used anonymised records from 379 students, with 15% marked as failing, and applied several machine learning algorithms. The first experiments showed poor recall for the failing group. However, using synthetic data generation methods led to a significant improvement in performance. Our results suggest that, when combined with synthetic data, machine learning can help identify at-risk students early in programming courses. This research lays the groundwork for validating and using these models with live student cohorts in the future, to allow for timely and effective interventions that can improve student outcomes. It also includes feature importance analysis to refine formative tasks.

Single cell construction is a paradigm that is used in each of these algorithms. The central property on which the CAD algorithm is based is called delineability.

A numerical simulation demonstrates fast and accurate real-time estimation of actuator loss of effectiveness and changes in the mass and inertia due to payload pickup/drop-off during delivery missions. The combined and uneven effects of multiple faults with initial mass and inertia uncertainties are efficiently compensated by this novel fault tolerant flight control strategy. The controller also improves the rejection of these uncertainties during the transient stage before the convergence of the parameter estimation. The proposed approach maintains the operational reliability of delivery quadcopters under a range of challenging uneven faults and significant mass and inertia uncertainties.",

We demonstrate this by using new data, along with a novel graph representation of reaction networks that is unique up to a permutation on the name of species of the network, to train a graph attention neural network model to predict multistationarity of reaction networks.

This study reports lessons on such use of machine learning in symbolic computation, in particular on the importance of analysing datasets prior to machine learning and on the different machine learning paradigms that may be utilised. We present results for a particular case study, the selection of variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition, but expect that the lessons learned are applicable to other decisions in symbolic computation. We utilise an existing dataset of examples derived from applications which was found to be imbalanced with respect to the variable ordering decision. We introduce an augmentation technique for polynomial systems problems that allows us to balance and further augment the dataset, improving the machine learning results by 28% and 38% on average, respectively. We then demonstrate how the existing machine learning methodology used for the problem—classification—might be recast into the regression paradigm. While this does not have a radical change on the performance, it does widen the scope in which the methodology can be applied to make choices.",

      "abstract": "Satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers check the satisfiability of quantifier-free first-order logic formulae over different theories. We consider the theory of non-linear real arithmetic where the formulae are logical combinations of polynomial constraints. Here a commonly used tool is the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) to decompose the real space into cells where the constraints are truth-invariant through the use of projection polynomials.A CAD encodes more information than necessary for checking satisfiability. One approach to address this is to repackage the CAD theory into a search-based algorithm: one that guesses sample points to satisfy the formula, and generalizes guesses that conflict constraints to cylindrical cells around samples which are avoided in the continuing search. This can lead to a satisfying assignment more quickly, or conclude unsatisfiability with far fewer cells. A notable example of this approach is Jovanović and de Moura's NLSAT algorithm. Since these cells are being produced locally to a sample there is scope to use fewer projection polynomials than the traditional CAD projection. The original NLSAT algorithm reduced the set a little; while Brown's single cell construction reduced it much further still. However, it refines a cell polynomial-by-polynomial, meaning the shape and size of the cell produced depends on the order in which the polynomials are considered.The present paper proposes a method to construct such cells levelwise, i.e. built level-by-level according to a variable ordering instead of polynomial-by-polynomial for all levels. We still use a reduced number of projection polynomials, but can now consider a variety of different reductions and use heuristics to select the projection polynomials in order to optimize the shape of the cell under construction. The new method can thus improve the performance of the NLSAT algorithm. We formulate all the necessary theory that underpins the algorithm as a proof syste",

By swapping the variable names in already labelled problems, we generate new problem instances that do not require any further labelling when viewing the selection as a classification problem. We find this augmentation increases the accuracy of ML models by 63% on average. We study what part of this improvement is due to the balancing of the dataset and what is achieved thanks to further increasing the size of the dataset, concluding that both have a very significant effect.

We then ran interviews with students after the end of the module to produce qualitative data on perceptions of what feedback is, how useful it is, the uses made of it, and how it bears on engagement. A general finding was that human and automated feedback are different but complementary. However there are different feedback needs by group. Our findings imply: (1) that a blended human-automated feedback approach improves engagement; and (2) that this approach needs to be differentiated according to type of student. We give implications for the design of feedback for programming modules.",

Accurate identification and sub-classification of lncRNAs is crucial for exploring their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify, classify and predict their biological functions in plant species. In this study, a novel computational framework called LncRNA identification and function prediction tool (LIFT) has been developed, which implements least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) optimisation and iterative random forests classification for selection of optimal features, a novel position-based classification (PBC) method for sub-classifying lncRNAs into different classes, and a Bayesian-based function prediction approach for annotating lncRNA transcripts. Using LASSO, LIFT selected 31 optimal features and achieved a 15-30% improvement in the prediction accuracy on plant species when evaluated against state-of-the-art CPC tools. Using PBC, LIFT successfully identified the intergenic and antisense transcripts with greater accuracy in the A. thaliana and Z. mays datasets.",

The algorithm is a variant of Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) adapted for satisfiability, where solution candidates (sample points) are constructed incrementally, either until a satisfying sample is found or sufficient samples have been sampled to conclude unsatisfiability. The choice of samples is guided by the input constraints and previous conflicts. The key idea behind our new approach is to start with a partial sample; demonstrate that it cannot be extended to a full sample; and from the reasons for that rule out a larger space around the partial sample, which build up incrementally into a cylindrical algebraic covering of the space. There are similarities with the incremental variant of CAD, the NLSAT method of Jovanović and de Moura, and the NuCAD algorithm of Brown; but we present worked examples and experimental results on a preliminary implementation to demonstrate the differences to these, and the benefits of the new approach.",

We refer to choices which have no effect on the mathematical correctness of the software, but do impact its performance.In the past we experimented with one such choice: the variable ordering to use when building a Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD). We used the Python library Scikit-Learn (sklearn) to experiment with different ML models, and developed new techniques for feature generation and hyper-parameter selection.These techniques could easily be adapted for making decisions other than our immediate application of CAD variable ordering. Hence in this paper we present a software pipeline to use sklearn to pick the variable ordering for an algorithm that acts on a polynomial system. The code described is freely available online.",

      "abstract": "Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) has long been one of the most important algorithms within Symbolic Computation, as a tool to perform quantifier elimination in first order logic over the reals. More recently it is finding prominence in the Satisfiability Checking community as a tool to identify satisfying solutions of problems in nonlinear real arithmetic.The original algorithm produces decompositions according to the signs of polynomials, when what is usually required is a decomposition according to the truth of a formula containing those polynomials. One approach to achieve that coarser (but hopefully cheaper) decomposition is to reduce the polynomials identified in the CAD to reflect a logical structure which reduces the solution space dimension: the presence of Equational Constraints (ECs).This paper may act as a tutorial for the use of CAD with ECs: we describe all necessary background and the current state of the art. In particular, we present recent work on how McCallum's theory of reduced projection may be leveraged to make further savings in the lifting phase: both to the polynomials we lift with and the cells lifted over. We give a new complexity analysis to demonstrate that the double exponent in the worst case complexity bound for CAD reduces in line with the number of ECs. We show that the reduction can apply to both the number of polynomials produced and their degree.",

We then describe our continuous assessment approach: where students earn a weekly mark by demonstrating progress to a teacher as an open presentation to the class. It involves a degree of self and peer assessment and allows for an assessment of group work that is both fair, and seen to be fair. It builds attendance, self-study / continuous engagement habits, public speaking / presentation skills, and rewards group members for making meaningful individual contributions.",

      "abstract": "We consider a problem from biological network analysis of determining regions in a parameter space over which there are multiple steady states for positive real values of variables and parameters. We describe multiple approaches to address the problem using tools from Symbolic Computation. We describe how progress was made to achieve semi-algebraic descriptions of the multistationarity regions of parameter space, and compare symbolic and numerical methods. The biological networks studied are models of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) network which has already consumed considerable effort using special insights into its structure of corresponding models. Our main example is a model with 11 equations in 11 variables and 19 parameters, 3 of which are of interest for symbolic treatment. The model also imposes positivity conditions on all variables and parameters. We apply combinations of symbolic computation methods designed for mixed equality / inequality systems, specifically virtual substitution, lazy real triangularization and cylindrical algebraic decomposition, as well as a simplification technique adapted from Gaussian elimination and graph theory. We are able to determine semi-algebraic conditions for multistationarity of our main example over a 2-dimensional parameter space. We also study a second MAPK model and a symbolic grid sampling technique which can locate such regions in 3-dimensional parameter space.",

We are particularly concerned with computer algebra systems (CASs), and in particular, our experiments are for selecting the variable ordering to use when performing a cylindrical algebraic decomposition of n-dimensional real space with respect to the signs of a set of polynomials.In our prior work we explored the different ML models that could be used, and how to identify suitable features of the input polynomials. In the present paper we both repeat our prior experiments on problems which have more variables (and thus exponentially more possible orderings), and examine the metric which our ML classifiers targets. The natural metric is computational runtime, with classifiers trained to pick the ordering which minimises this. However, this leads to the situation were models do not distinguish between any of the non-optimal orderings, whose runtimes may still vary dramatically. In this paper we investigate a modification to the cross-validation algorithms of the classifiers so that they do distinguish these cases, leading to improved results.",

Our focus is selecting the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD), an important algorithm implemented in several CASs, and now also SMT-solvers. We created a framework to describe all the previously identified ML features for the problem and then enumerated all options in this framework to automatically generate many more features. We validate the usefulness of these with an experiment which shows that an ML choice for CAD variable ordering is superior to those made by human created heuristics, and further improved with these additional features. This technique of feature generation could be useful for other choices related to CAD, or even choices for other algorithms in CASs / SMT-solvers with polynomial systems as input.",

We address the problem of selecting the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD), an important algorithm in Symbolic Computation. Prior work to apply ML on this problem implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to select between three existing human-made heuristics, which did better than anyone heuristic alone. Here we extend this result by training ML models to select the variable ordering directly, and by trying out a wider variety of ML techniques. We experimented with the NLSAT dataset and the Regular Chains Library CAD function for Maple 2018. For each problem, the variable ordering leading to the shortest computing time was selected as the target class for ML. Features were generated from the polynomial input and used to train the following ML models: k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT) and SVM, as implemented in the Python scikit-learn package. We also compared these with the two leading human-made heuristics for the problem: the Brown heuristic and sotd. On this dataset all of the ML approaches outperformed the human-made heuristics, some by a large margin.",

      "year": "2019",
      "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs which play a significant role in several biological processes. RNA-seq based transcriptome sequencing has been extensively used for identification of lncRNAs. However, accurate identification of lncRNAs in RNA-seq datasets is crucial for exploring their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify them in transcriptomic data. Well-known CPC tools such as CPC2, lncScore, CPAT are primarily designed for prediction of lncRNAs based on the GENCODE, NONCODE and CANTATAdb databases. The prediction accuracy of these tools often drops when tested on transcriptomic datasets. This leads to higher false positive results and inaccuracy in the function annotation process. In this study, we present a novel tool, PLIT, for the identification of lncRNAs in plants RNA-seq datasets. PLIT implements a feature selection method based on L1 regularization and iterative Random Forests (iRF) classification for selection of optimal features. Based on sequence and codon-bias features, it classifies the RNA-seq derived FASTA sequences into coding or long non-coding transcripts. Using L1 regularization, 31 optimal features were obtained based on lncRNA and protein-coding transcripts from 8 plant species. The performance of the tool was evaluated on 7 plant RNA-seq datasets using 10-fold cross-validation. The analysis exhibited superior accuracy when evaluated against currently available state-of-the-art CPC tools.",

However, it has a worst case complexity doubly exponential in the size of the input, which is often encountered in practice. It has been observed that for many problems a change in algorithm settings or problem formulation can cause huge differences in runtime costs, changing problem instances from intractable to easy. A number of heuristics have been developed to help with such choices, but the complicated nature of the geometric relationships involved means these are imperfect and can sometimes make poor choices. We investigate the use of machine learning (specifically support vector machines) to make such choices instead. Machine learning is the process of fitting a computer model to a complex function based on properties learned from measured data. In this paper we apply it in two case studies: the first to select between heuristics for choosing a CAD variable ordering; the second to identify when a CAD problem instance would benefit from Gröbner Basis preconditioning. These appear to be the first such applications of machine learning to Symbolic Computation. We demonstrate in both cases that the machine learned choice outperforms human developed heuristics.",

We demonstrate that the determination of multistationarity of an 11-dimensional MAPK network with can be achieved by currently available methodswhen numeric values are known for all but potentially one parameter.

      "abstract": "The social media network phenomenon creates massive amounts of valuable data that is available online and easy to access. Many users share images, videos, comments, reviews, news and opinions on different social networks sites, with Twitter being one of the most popular ones. Data collected from Twitter is highly unstructured, and extracting useful information from tweets is a challenging task. Twitter has a huge number of Arabic users who mostly post and write their tweets using the Arabic language. While there has been a lot of research on sentiment analysis in English, the amount of researches and datasets in Arabic language is limited.This paper introduces an Arabic language dataset, which is about opinions on health services and has been collected from Twitter. The paper will first detail the process of collecting the data from Twitter and also the process of filtering, pre-processing and annotating the Arabic text in order to build a big sentiment analysis dataset in Arabic. Several Machine Learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) alongside Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks were utilized in our experiments of sentiment analysis on our health dataset.Publisher Statement: © 2017 IEEE.

However, it can be expensive, with worst case complexity doubly exponential in the size of the input. Hence it is important to formulate the problem in the best manner for the CAD algorithm. One possibility is to precondition the input polynomials using Groebner Basis (GB) theory. Previous experiments have shown that while this can often be very beneficial to the CAD algorithm, for some problems it can significantly worsen the CAD performance. In the present paper we investigate whether machine learning, specifically a support vector machine (SVM), may be used to identify those CAD problems which benefit from GB preconditioning. We run experiments with over 1000 problems (many times larger than previous studies) and find that the machine learned choice does better than the human-made heuristic.",

Nevertheless, the Bezout bound tells us that number of zeros of a zero-dimensional system is singly-exponential in the number of variables. How should this contradiction be reconciled? We first note that Mayr and Ritscher in 2013 showed the doubly exponential nature of Gröbner bases is with respect to the dimension of the ideal, not the number of variables. This inspires us to consider what can be done for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition which produces a doubly-exponential number of polynomials of doubly-exponential degree. We review work from ISSAC 2015 which showed the number of polynomials could be restricted to doubly-exponential in the (complex) dimension using McCallum’s theory of reduced projection in the presence of equational constraints. We then discuss preliminary results showing the same for the degree of those polynomials. The results are under primitivity assumptions whose importance we illustrate.",

This observation motivates our article and definition of a Truth Table Invariant CAD (TTICAD). In ISSAC 2013 the current authors presented an algorithm that can efficiently and directly construct a TTICAD for a list of formulae in which each has an equational constraint. This was achieved by generalising McCallum's theory of reduced projection operators. In this paper we present an extended version of our theory which can be applied to an arbitrary list of formulae, achieving savings if at least one has an equational constraint. We also explain how the theory of reduced projection operators can allow for further improvements to the lifting phase of CAD algorithms, even in the context of a single equational constraint. The algorithm is implemented fully in Maple and we present both promising results from experimentation and a complexity analysis showing the benefits of our contributions.",

We find that they follow a standard distribution which seems largely independent of the underlying problem or CAD algorithm used. Rather, the distribution is inherent to the cylindrical structure and determined mostly by the number of variables. This insight is then combined with an algorithm that produces only full-dimensional cells to give an accurate method of predicting the number of cells in a complete CAD. Since constructing only full-dimensional cells is relatively inexpensive (involving no costly algebraic number calculations) this leads to heuristics for helping with various questions of problem formulation for CAD, such as choosing an optimal variable ordering. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach can be highly effective.",

      "abstract": "It has long been known that cylindrical algebraic decompositions (CADs) can in theory be used for robot motion planning. However, in practice even the simplest examples can be too complicated to tackle. We consider in detail a ''Piano Mover's Problem'' which considers moving an infinitesimally thin piano (or ladder) through a right-angled corridor. Producing a CAD for the original formulation of this problem is still infeasible after 25 years of improvements in both CAD theory and computer hardware. We review some alternative formulations in the literature which use differing levels of geometric analysis before input to a CAD algorithm. Simpler formulations allow CAD to easily address the question of the existence of a path. We provide a new formulation for which both a CAD can be constructed and from which an actual path could be determined if one exists, and analyse the CADs produced using this approach for variations of the problem. This emphasises the importance of the precise formulation of such problems for CAD. We analyse the formulations and their CADs considering a variety of heuristics and general criteria, leading to conclusions about tackling other problems of this form.",

This leads to new heuristics for choosing: the variable ordering for a CAD problem, a designated equational constraint, and formulations for truth-table invariant CADs (TTICADs).

The first approach discussed sees the functions defined as logarithmic derivatives of the σ-function, a modified Riemann θ-function. We can make use of known properties of the σ-function to derive power series expansions and in turn the properties mentioned above. This approach has been extended to a wide range of non hyperelliptic and higher genus curves and an overview of recent results is given. The second approach defines the functions algebraically, after first modifying the curve into its equivariant form. This approach allows the use of representation theory to derive a range of results at lower computational cost. We discuss the development of this theory for hyperelliptic curves and how it may be extended in the future. We consider how the two approaches may be combined, giving the explicit mappings for the genus 3 hyperelliptic theory.

The thesis of this paper is that there is a class of problems that fall between these two, which could be described as ''does the low-level arithmetic implement the high-level mathematics''. Many of these problems arise because mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the complex numbers, is more difficult than expected: for example the complex function log is not continuous, writing down a program to compute an inverse function is more complicated than just solving an equation, and many algebraic simplification rules are not universally valid. The good news is that these problems are theoretically capable of being solved, and are practically close to being solved, but not yet solved, in several real-world examples. However, there is still a long way to go before implementations match the theoretical possibilities.",

However, regional efforts, considering historical emissions, remain underexplored. Here, we assess energy system changes, technology adoption, and investments needed for developing regions, including five major- and minor-emitting nations. Our analysis, using an integrated assessment model, shows a large gap in regional efforts toward global net-zero emissions, stemming from the necessary shift of energy systems to low-carbon resources. The use of new technologies, like electric vehicles, hydrogen, and carbon capture, varies by region, with the highest adoption required between 2020 and 2030. Financing this shift needs an average gross domestic product (GDP) investment rise of 0.464% in minor-emitting regions and up to 2.1% in major-emitting regions by 2085. Our results could guide policies and support setting quantifiable targets for developing nations. The findings are key to facilitating strategic technology use and finance mobilization to achieve a carbon-neutral future.",

However, micro-grid solutions are often inflexible and lack functionality to respond to displaced community energy needs and ensure the long-term sustainability of interventions. This paper explores the use of fog-computing retrofit architectures deployed on community micro-grid infrastructures to enable flexible demand management to improve service delivery and longevity. A micro-services solution is proposed that decouples components increasing resilience and testability while allowing hybrid edge-cloud deployments. The architecture is outlined and demonstrated for a micro-grid providing energy to two nurseries and a playground in Kigeme refugee camp, Rwanda. To enact the community priorities within the demand management system, modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods are outlined and tested for different use-case scenarios. The performance of the modified GA methods are then compared with a pre-existing battery protect controller and an alternative deterministic (space-shared) energy manager model. A modified search space GA method was required for GA to outperform both the existing battery controller and proposed deterministic method in terms of achieving the highest utility function in almost every use-case. The results further showed how simple community priorities can be set and used to enact control on the system in 24h timeframes that are in line with the local decision-making context.",

Yet, there is a widening gap between over 80 million displaced people and the political will to meet their needs. Improving energy access in the displaced setting to build capacity and resilience requires meaningful integration of the needs of communities throughout the design, delivery and evaluation process within the socio-technical energy system. This paper aims to explore the ways in which co-design is conceptualised and applied, from an interdisciplinary perspective, within the socio-technical framing. We do this by first conducting a rapid review of relevant co-design literature to understand theories, typologies and identify methods of best co-design practice in the Humanitarian Energy sector. Second, we present the Humanitarian Engineering and Energy for Displacement project as a co-design case study for Humanitarian Energy using Technology Implementation Model for Energy (TIME) as a framework for analysis. Our rapid review resulted in the typology of the Spectrum of Co-Design, a mapping of differing conceptualisations of co-design showing their positioning and interactions. Our results show that by exploring if and how conceptual frameworks, such as TIME, adds value to practitioner orientated humanitarian programming this can make a significant contribution to future proofing energy systems that seek to deliver inclusive, sustainable and just transitions. We highlight specific learnings from HEED around the disconnection between perceptions of key stakeholder roles, misunderstandings of energy access and use, and building trusting partnerships through the creation of meaningful rectification pathways.",

The intermittent nature of renewable sources affects the pricing of energy sold or purchased. The networks are subject to operational constraints, voltage limits at each node, rated capacities for the power electronic devices, and current bounds for distribution lines. These economic and technical constraints, coupled with intermittent renewable injection, may pose a threat to system stability and performance. In this article, we propose a novel holistic approach to energy trading composed of a distributed predictive control framework to handle physical interactions, i.e., voltage constraints and power dispatch, together with a negotiation framework to determine pricing policies for energy transactions. We study the effect of forecasting generation and consumption on the overall network's performance and market behaviors. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for both the negotiation framework and the distributed control. Finally, we assess the impact of forecasting in the proposed system with the aid of testing scenarios.",

This raises ethical concerns around issues such as security and privacy. While there is a strong culture of regulatory compliance, there is a significantly less established understanding of ethical practices and frameworks in the UK energy sector.This briefing paper details work conducted by EnergyREV researchers exploring understanding and experience of ethics and AI, as the sector moves towards greater employment of technology in the data collection, storage and use processes. By addressing ethical concerns from the outset, taking a proactive rather than reactive approach, risks can be mitigated, and potential issues addressed early on, leading to more opportunities for technological advancement and innovation.Through engagement with energy actors, an understanding of how ethics is applied by those working in the energy data sector will be improved",

However, if applications are to fully benefit from SOM based techniques, high-speed processing is demanding, given that data tends to be both highly dimensional and yet “big”. Hence, a fully parallel architecture for the SOM is introduced to optimize the system’s data processing time. Unlike most literature approaches, the architecture proposed here does not contain sequential steps - a common limiting factor for processing speed. The architecture was validated on FPGA and evaluated concerning hardware throughput and the use of resources. Comparisons to the state of the art show a speedup of 8.91x over a partially serial implementation, using less than 15% of hardware resources available. Thus, the method proposed here points to a hardware architecture that will not be obsolete quickly.",

Displaced settlements often lack street lighting and electricity. Given that off-grid solar streetlights produce surplus energy, we hypothesized that this energy could be made available for daily usage, to improve system performance and provide further energy access to displaced populations. We recognize, however, that solar streetlight performance and longevity have typically been poor in remote and refugee settings. Eleven solar streetlights were fitted with ground-level sockets and their performance monitored, in two displaced settlements: a refugee camp in Rwanda and an internally displaced population settlement in Nepal. Considerable performance gaps were found across all eleven systems. Inefficient lights and mismatching system components were major issues at both sites, reducing targeted designed performance ratios by 33% and 53% on average in Rwanda and Nepal, respectively. The challenges of deploying these types of systems in temporary settlements are outlined and a number of suggestions are made to guide future developments in the design and implementation of sustainable solar streetlight interventions.",

      "abstract": "In response to the increasing number of displaced people, the humanitarian sector is exploring innovation as a framework to improve the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Traditionally, the focus on camp settings and short term solutions have resulted in a humanitarian response that is slow to adapt to the rapidity of technological innovation (Betts and Bloom, 2014). For example, 87.8% of African’s in Sub-Saharan Africa have a mobile phone (World Bank, 2019), yet 80% of displaced people living in camps in this same region still cook over open fires which are linked to long term health and environmental effects (Grafham and Lahn, 2018).As a result of the lessons learned from the Humanitarian Engineering and Energy for Displacement (HEED) project around the different perceptions of innovation between key energy stakeholders, this paper looks to engage with questions around ensuring innovation in the humanitarian sector, and more specifically humanitarian energy, is responsible. How can we define responsible? Is responsible innovation a theoretical nicety or can it ensure a just energy transition as outlined by the SDGs? What does responsible innovation look like in reality? Building to our underlying research question: what is the state-of-the-art in responsible innovation for humanitarian energy and how is it implemented at project level?",

Specifically, an evidence base was built around two community co-conceived standalone photovoltaic-battery systems, which were deployed in two refugee camps in Rwanda. We found that for both installations (a micro-grid and a community hall electrification system) energy consumption levels were low, showing that sizeable energy consumption gaps can still develop when co-conceived interventions are deployed. The consumption gap led to low performance ratios (33% and 25% respectively for the micro-grid and community hall system). To guide further work and improve the sustainability of community interventions, we draw a number of design principles for future energy interventions in similar contexts. To deliver sustainable energy transitions for refugees, there needs to be a move towards co-creating community interventions that promote self-governance to position communities as users, maintainers and suppliers of energy services, throughout an intervention's lifetime.",

      "year": "2020",
      "abstract": "Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are widely used as a data mining technique for applications that require data dimensionality reduction and clustering. Given the complexity of the SOM learning phase and the massive dimensionality of many data sets as well as their sample size in Big Data applications, high-speed processing is critical when implementing SOM approaches. This paper proposes a new hardware approach to SOM implementation, exploiting parallelization, to optimize the system's processing time. Unlike most implementations in the literature, this proposed approach allows the parallelization of the data dimensions instead of the map, ensuring high processing speed regardless of data dimensions. An implementation with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is presented and evaluated. Key evaluation metrics are processing time (or throughput) and FPGA area occupancy (or hardware resources).",

      "abstract": "Whilst technological breakthroughs alone cannot revolutionise energy access for refugees, a number of innovations are offering the possibility of transformational change. One area, explored in this chapter by the University of Coventry, is the need for wireless sensor networks and communication technology to gather data to inform systematic decision making. This chapter reviews a range of energy technologies and delivery approaches that have been trialled in camps, including discussion of the resulting problems and challenges that have been met. The chapter makes the case for improved energy intervention planning and identifies multi-criteria decision-making approaches that could be utilised in the context of refugee camps for dealing with both evaluation and design problems. The chapter concludes by exploring the possibility of using alternative wireless sensors and monitoring devices to gather data on a range of energy systems to inform decision making and management of shared community resources.",

      "year": "2018",
      "abstract": "Refugee camps are meant to be temporary settlements, but many exist for several decades. It has been estimated that only around 11% of people living in refugee camps have access to energy for lighting; a lack of basic energy services has resulted in serious issues regarding safety at night, food preservation and in-door air pollution. Refugees’ quality of life could therefore be significantly improved with appropriate energy interventions. Different photovoltaic-based solutions comprising of portable, modular and fixed installations have been tested in camps, but poor maintenance, unclear ownership and a lack of cultural understanding have often caused projects to fail. Moreover, the use of portable and modular systems is relatively well-established in camps, but there is limited research on the implementation and operation of micro-grid systems. There are also large uncertainties with energy purchases in temporary settlements, and design optimisation based on key financial indicators, such as levelised cost of electricity, might not necessarily give the best solution for a refugee camp. In this study, camp sites in Rwanda and Nepal are used as case study locations for designing and comparing alternative PV-based energy interventions for street lighting, water pumping and household electrification. These interventions are defined using primary data collected via surveys carried out at the camp sites and using the Multi-tier Energy Access Tracking Framework. To establish a baseline, conventional system sizing and optimisation based on energy cost is carried out using HOMER Pro®The differences in possible modular or micro-grid system designs are compared, with alterative system variations being modelled to determine a trade-off between reliability and cost. The financial implications of supply and user preferences’ uncertainties are investigated and comparedwith data gathered on current monthly household income and expenditure. An outcome from the study is several ene",

We ran a survey with 190 students, complemented by environmental monitoring together with observational work, to understand energy attitudes and behaviour in order to draw implications on potential behaviour change interventions. While students showed much interest in ecological issues there was much lower awareness of impacts of the use of appliances, and no observed energy-saving action by students. Thus, while attitudes supporting behaviour change appear to be in place, this is not yet translating into action. Drawing on Social Practice Theory (SPT, Shove et al, 2012), we propose that this is to do with absence of salience (energy use is not the key focus of student activity), together with absence of licence (students appear not to feel they are permitted). We draw implications for future behaviour change work amongst the Indonesian student body centring on energy-saving AC use.",

Current investigations follow two general themes: agent-based systems and query-based systems.

A parser for the language and its formal specification were seen as an essential first step in being able to issue correct, purposeful queries to the network. A simple specification model that could be incrementally refined through to implementation was considered essential in accomplishing this goal. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is two-fold.

      "abstract": "Greater availability and affordability of wireless technology has led to an increase in the number of wireless sensor network (WSN) applications where sense data is collected at a central user point, commonly outside the network (geographically and topologically) for processing. Resource constraints on nodes in the network coupled with considerable redundancy in the data generated mean that applications have to be developed with an eye to maximising energy efficiency in order to extend network life. In-network computation, and in particular in-network information extraction from data, has been promoted as a technique for achieving this aim. In-network processing, however, has been limited to systems where at most, simple aggregate queries are evaluated, the results of which are communicated to the outside world. There is currently little research into how the idea of in-network processing can be extended and implemented to allow more complex queries to be resolved within the network. This paper examines key applicative query-based approaches that utilise in-network processing for query resolution, identifies their strengths and limitations and puts forward ideas for facilitating in-network complex query processing in WSNs. Finally, preliminary results of experiments, where in-network attribute-based logical abstractions are used for processing complex queries, are presented. Copyright 2007 ACM.",

      "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks typically gather data at a number of locations. However, it is desirable to be able to design applications and reason about the data in more abstract forms than points of data. This paper examines one way in which this can be done. By bestowing the ability to predict inter-node values upon the network, it is proposed that it will become possible to build applications that are unaware of the concrete reality of sparse data. This interpolation capability is realised as a service of the network. We present an implementation of this service and discuss its merits and shortcomings. Additionally, we present an initial application of the service in the form of isopleth generation. That is, the delineation of contours of constant parameter value. Finally, we discuss the improvements required to create more sophisticated applications and services and examine the benefits these improvements would bring.",

With MuMHR, robustness is achieved by each node learning multiple paths and election of cluster-head backup node(s). Energy expenditure is reduced by shortening the distance between the node and its cluster-head and by reducing the setup communication overhead. This is done through incorporating the number-of-hops metric in addition to the back-off waiting time. Simulation results show that MuMHR performs better than LEACH, which is the most promising hierarchical routing algorithm to date; MuMHR reduces the total number of set-up messages by up to 65% and enhances the data delivery ratio by up to 0.83. © 2007 IEEE.",

      "abstract": "As research on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) matures and the number of real life deployments increases, locationing (the problem of finding the physical placing of sensors without prior knowledge of their position) is attracting considerable interest. In almost any WSN application, localization knowledge within the network is a necessity: A sensor's data are only useful if put in context of where it came from - this is particularly the case in field sensing applications (i.e, the sensing of a phenomonen over an area or volume). The accuracy of localization therefore directly affects the accuracy of the information derived from the network. This paper describes the characterization of the accuracy achievable when localization is based on range data derived from acoustic time-of-flight measurements, and the consequent accuracy of the derived sensing surface.",

      "year": "2006",
      "abstract": "A study conducted by the authors on some contemporary designs for wireless sensor nodes, or motes shows a large disparity in the level of resources, in terms of processor power and available memory. There are essentially two schools of thought on the appropriate scale of hardware to include in a mote design: The 'small mote' camp motivates their approach based on an argument centring on cost, power consumption and potential for integration into a single chip design. The 'large mote' camp cites an expected level of needed computational power, derived from top-down design considerations, as a reason for the scale of the resources designed into their motes. The authors have recently begun to plan some real world, large, field sensing applications, typical of the type of task that may be required for any sensor networks deployed to deliver field maps over real surfaces. In this paper the relative merits of 'big' and 'small' motes are compared in three categories, which are considered by most researchers to be important for the construction of successful wireless sensor networks. The categories are: size, power consumption and cost. In none of these is the big mote found to be at a disadvantage compared to the small mote, and there appear to be definite advantages of big motes with respect to cost and power consumption, at least for the types of application for which large sensor networks may be useful. As a result of these consideration, a specification for a 'big mote' is proposed.",

Smart MEMS and Sensor Systems presents readers with the means to understand, evaluate, appreciate and participate in the development of the field, from a unique systems perspective. The combination of MEMS and integrated intelligence has been put forward as a disruptive technology. The full potential of this technology is only evident when it is used to construct very large pervasive sensing systems. The book explores the many different technologies needed to build such systems and integrates knowledge from three different domains: MEMS technology, sensor system electronics and pervasive computing science. Throughout the book a top-down design perspective is taken, be it for the development of a single smart sensor or that of adaptive ad-hoc networks of millions of sensors. For experts in any of the domains named above the book provides the context for their MEMS based design work and an understanding of the role the other domains play. For the generalist (either in engineering or computing) or the technology manager the underpinning knowledge is provided, which can inform specialist decision making. © 2006 by Imperial College Press.

      "year": "2006",
      "abstract": "This paper considers some of the systems level issues concerned with the building of large scale sensing systems composed of autonomous Intelligent sensors. The work is motivated by the potential offered by monolithic, integrated, intelligent MEMS sensors. They provide very low cost sensing in a form which may be included in 'smart structures' for example, in which structural diagnostic capability Is deeply integrated into the structure itself. Designing and implementing such large sensing systems, however, raises a number of challenges, of which, many are still far from being resolved. Optimal redundancy, the follow on issue of fault management and their strategic consequences on the overall systems design requirements are chosen for discussion here. When considering the above, extended network lifetime is an important goal in the system design process. A 'peer to peer' architecture of autonomous sensors, with no specialised control or processing nodes in the network is taken as the starting point of the discussion. This architecture Is often put forward as being suitable for high reliability requirements, as the operation of the systems is not dependent on the operation of a single, specialised resource. Given that reliability generally depends on redundancy within the array an aim is the optimization of the level of redundancy in that array. Optimal redundancy depends on two systems functions. The first is a means by which a sensor in such an array may self detect fault conditions, and the second is the provision of a reliable means of handling these faults. A method of fault detection based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is described, which allows a sensor to detect whether it is functioning correctly, based on its own signal and that provided by a single neighbouring sensor. Within a decentralised, peer to peer network the identification of a neighbour and the subsequent handling of fault conditions require careful consideration, since, without a centrali",

      "abstract": "SMIL (Synchronised Multimedia Integration Language) is an XML language for the distribution of synchronised video, sound and other media in presentations, and is likely to be the preferred format for distribution of multimedia presentations that include synchronised and streamed media. Previous work has argued that conventional hypermedia design methods provide insufficient design rigour to allow their use with confidence for safety and mission critical applications. It was shown how formal methods, derived from the theory of computer science, could be applied to the design of hypermedia presentations to provide a rigorous design technique. Two limitations of this work are discussed. The first is its restriction to closed systems. Although it was argued that most safety critical hypermedia systems are closed, this is not the case with many 'mission critical' applications, particularly those in e-business. The second limitation is the application of the technique to a relatively small number of media. Again, safety critical applications tend to be conservative in their use of media, but it would be advantageous for many other application areas if this constraint were not there. This paper discusses how this work may be extended in two key areas to remove these limitations. The first allows the method to be used the design of SMIL presentations, providing a means of rigorous design for synchronised and streamed media, necessary in these media are to be used in safety and mission critical applications, and is achieved by a detailed extension of the underlying models on which the method is based to cover the operation of SMIL.

These requirements extend beyond the normally accepted safety-critical systems (e.g. nuclear reactors, chemical plants, and aircraft) to new systems such as autonomous vehicles and rapid transport systems. Early detection of faults and/or malfunctions in industrial processes and systems can help reduce downtimes and the incidence of catastrophic events. Sensors are essential components of any process or system which makes use of automatic control. It follows that an important aspect of any process/system fault diagnosis strategy is to attempt to determine their state of functionality. The paper opens a discussion on the appropriateness of local sensor health monitoring, fault diagnosis and measurement confidence indices. It looks at the techniques currently used for process fault detection, both centralised and hierarchical, and explores further the possibilities of transposing some of the design concepts from macrosystem level to microsystems, in respect to fault diagnosis. The use of Artificial Intelligence techniques is suggested for implementing on-chip sensor diagnosis. Micromachined accelerometers are considered as a case study.",

Three noise sources are present in such an electromechanical closed loop system: mechanical noise due to Brownian motion, electronic noise introduced by the interface circuit due to thermal noise sources in the electronic devices and quantisation noise due to the analog to digital conversion process. It is well known that the sigma-delta modulator system shapes the quantisation noise in an advantageous way by attenuating it in the signalband. It is shown here that it also shapes the electronic noise favorably. However, this property is less pronounced. The Brownian noise remains unaffected in the signal band. With the outlined simulation procedures it is possible to predict the dominant noise contributions for different sampling frequencies of the sigma-delta control system and hence design an optimized control system.",

All three approaches rely on balancing the inertial force acting on the proof mass by electrostatic actuation, the magnitude of which provides a measure of the acceleration signal.

The competitive world of social networks and the variety of servicesthey provide have persuaded users to apply for the membership of several networks. This situation makes involvement ofthe shared individuals across multiple social networks essential for the effective dissemination of information. In this paper,we introduce a community-based entropic method to identify influential nodes in multiple social networks, taking intoaccount the effect of shared users. The proposed method, titled IM2-SE, focuses on calculating a total structural entropy foreach node. This structural entropy is defined as the weighted sum of the structural entropies of the node in the networks andin the communities, it belongs to. The structural entropy of a node is based on Tsallis entropy considering both local andglobal structures of the network, and it utilizes the degree of centrality and betweenness centrality. Then, the nodes with thehighest total structural entropy are identified as the influential nodes. The empirical evaluation of the proposed method onthe real-world datasets including homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, demonstrates its superior performance to thebaseline methods. Furthermore, the impact of the shared nodes between networks in identifying the influential nodes hasbeen examined, revealing that up to 50% of the identified influential nodes are the shared nodes between specific networks.",

Communication-based adaptive protection can address this issue, but communication system components like sensors can fail. This research proposes a genetic algorithm-based approach to optimally place redundant sensors, minimizing protection blinding under communication uncertainty within a redundancy budget. The fault tolerance, measured by a new metric called redundancy degree, reflects the number of redundant components deployed. Results demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness in optimizing redundant sensor locations, reducing system costs, and improving fault tolerance. For the system and scenarios investigated, an average of 60% redundant sensors are relocated, reducing the average protection trip time by 36.65% compared to a baseline approach that does not consider communication uncertainty. This encourages incorporating communication component failure considerations in power system planning.",

We model the edge fog-cloud computing continuum as a multi-agent framework consisting of networked resource supply and demand agents. Inspired by the swarm intelligence behavior of the ant colony optimization, we propose a workload scheduler for the arriving demand agents to increase local resource utilization and reduce communication costs without relying on a centralized scheduler. Like the ants, the demand agents will release pheromones on the resource agent to indicate the available resources. The next arriving demand agent will most probably choose a neighbor, following the pheromone value and communication cost. The framework’s performance is evaluated in terms of local resource utilization, dependency on fog and cloud, and communication cost. We compare these metrics for the ant-inspired algorithm with random and greedy algorithms.The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm inspired by swarm intelligence can increase resource utilization at the edge and reduce the dependency on higher layers, while also decreasing the communication cost for the task of resource allocation",

      "abstract": "Protection blinding is a challenging issue in renewables-penetrated distribution grids and refers to a situation where a circuit breaker may not trip due to fault current contribution from distributed generation. This research addresses how the distributed generation location and capacity impact the operation of the circuit breaker in terms of the response time of the circuit breakers. The relative electrical distances of the faults and distributed generation to the circuit breakers are considered. The impact of distributed generation capacity considering the fault location is characterized using a new index called the heterogeneity index. The electrical distance between distributed generations and circuit breakers and the electrical distance between fault and circuit breaker is considered by a second new index called the electrical distance ratio. Data analysis on simulation results shows that these indices capture the phenomena of protection blinding caused by distributed generation. Results show that a higher distributed generation penetration and faults that are electrically further away from a circuit breaker show severe cases of protection blinding captured by the indices. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how these indices can identify the worst impacted locations in the distribution grid. A key result is that protection blinding does not necessarily occur solely due to the presence of distributed generation between a circuit breaker and a fault, but is dependent on factors such as distributed generation location in the distribution grid, fault level, fault level distribution across the generation units and fault location.",

In interaction-CASCADE, the total incurred overload after each component failure is the same as the CASCADE; however, the overload transfers to the out neighbors of the failed component given by the interaction graph. We first assume that the component’s initial loads are independent of their out- and in-degrees in the interaction graph and show that even though the process’s dynamics depend on the interaction graphs’ structure, the critical load beyond which the probability of total failure is significant does not change.

      "abstract": "Network controllability refers to the ability to steer the state of a network towards a target state by driving certain nodes, known as input nodes. This concept can be applied to brain networks for studying brain function and its relation to the structure, which has numerous practical applications. Brain network controllability involves using external signals such as electrical stimulation to drive specific brain regions and navigate the neurophysiological activity level of the brain around the state space. Although controllability is mainly theoretical, the energy required for control is critical in real-world implementations. With a focus on the structural brain networks, this study explores the impact of white matter fiber architecture on the control energy in brain networks using the theory of how input node placement affects the LCC (the longest distance between inputs and other network nodes). Initially, we use a single input node as it is theoretically possible to control brain networks with just one input. We show that highly connected brain regions that lead to lower LCCs are more energy-efficient as a single input node. However, there may still be a need for a significant amount of control energy with one input, and achieving controllability with less energy could be of interest. We identify the minimum number of input nodes required to control brain networks with smaller LCCs, demonstrating that reducing the LCC can significantly decrease the control energy in brain networks. Our results show that relying solely on highly connected nodes is not effective in controlling brain networks with lower energy by using multiple inputs because of densely interconnected brain network hubs. Instead, a combination of low and high-degree nodes is necessary.",

Control of linear dynamics through a minimum set of inputs, however, often has prohibitively large energy requirements and there is an inherent trade-off between minimizing the number of inputs and control energy. To better understand this trade-off, we study the problem of identifying a minimum set of input nodes such that controllabililty is ensured while restricting the length of the longest control chain. The longest control chain is the maximum distance from input nodes to any network node, and recent work found that reducing its length significantly reduces control energy. We map the longest control chain-constraint minimum input problem to finding a joint maximum matching and minimum dominating set. We show that this graph combinatorial problem is NP-complete, and we introduce and validate a heuristic approximation. Applying this algorithm to a collection of real and model networks, we investigate how network structure affects the minimum number of inputs, revealing, for example, that for many real networks reducing the longest control chain requires only few or no additional inputs, only the rearrangement of the input nodes.",

Such cascades are rooted in non-obvious, long-range, and higher-order couplings among the lines’ flows induced by physical constraints on the network. Failure interaction graph encodes which and to what extent other lines in a networked system are affected after each line failure and can help to predict the final state after an initial disturbance. We perform data analytics on the final lines’ steady states of cascade trajectories to infer a specific line’s state given the states of others. We use a generative model to reconstruct possible steady states, and a predictive model aims to predict the probability of each line’s failures after the initial failure as a regression problem. The generative model uses regularized pseudolikelihood estimator to infer interaction weights by solving the inverse Ising problem and deploys Glauber dynamics to generate steady states. The discriminative model uses boosted trees to efficiently learn over training and predict over test data the state of each line as a target finding an appropriate subset of other lines’ states as explanatory variables. We analyze the degree distribution of the corresponding interaction graphs to study the number of other components affected by each line failure (out-degree) or the number of lines that affect the state of a given line (in-degree). Both models show that the in-degree follows a power-law distribution.

The traditional least recently used (LRU) content replacement algorithm uses the statistical popularity of contents to increase the cache's hit ratio.

RSIM evaluates the eigenvalue sensitivity of all edges in a network in the presents of stochastic disturbances based on the Monte Carlo algorithm. Through the values of RSIM elements, the sensitive edges are identifiable. In addition, the contribution of each edge in network instability has been compared through different percentages of disturbances. Different percentages of disturbances did not change the results.

We implement a general algorithm for our perturbation method valid for different Laplacian-based link prediction schemes that successfully surpass the prediction accuracy of their standard non-perturbed versions in real-world and model networks. The suggested LPM for link prediction also exhibits higher accuracy compared to other extensively used local and global state-of-the-art techniques and, in particular, it outperform the Structural Perturbation Method (SPM), a popular procedure that perturbs the adjacency matrix of a network for inferring missing links, in many real-world and in synthetic networks.

The primary user emulation (PUE) attack is one of these threats in which malicious users try to emulate the primary user signals to prevent the secondary users (SU) from accessing the idle frequency spectrums. In this article, we propose a scheme to defend against the PUE attacker using an adaptive Bayesian learning automaton algorithm named Multichannel Bayesian Learning Automata (MBLA). MBLA uses two different channels simultaneously to have faster and more accurate learning in non-stationary environments and selecting the optimal frequency channel in each time slot. We assume no prior information about the channel statistics like availability probabilities and primary user activities. In this scheme, the SU synchronizes with its receiver using an approach based on the uncoordinated frequency hopping (UFH) and sends its data on different channels, which are obtained by MBLA. We extract the best strategies for the attacker and the SU and then investigate the proposed scheme in terms of the SU throughput in the presence of the PUE attacker. Simulation results are provided to show the convergence speed of the MBLA algorithm and the network performance in terms of the SU throughput and overhead of the control message passing in the CR networks compared to other schemes.",

Applying these algorithms to a broad range of real networks, we show the gap between the upper and lower bounds can vary dramatically across different degree sequences. Thus, we introduce the notion of structural control complexity to capture how much more difficult it is to control a specific network beyond what is required given its degree sequence, suggesting additional structure is present. Using model networks, we numerically and analytically investigate how typical features of the degree distribution affect the range of required driver nodes.

Homophily in interests speeds up the adoption of the information spreading process. Communities provide a coarse grain representative of network users with common interests. Here, we address the effects of community structures on the virality of information in social networks. We use real data sets of the Twitter network, and we show that in many viral hashtags, some communities characterized by a high ratio of inter-connections to intra-connection have appeared at the initial stages of meme adaptation. We show that the adoption of a hashtag in these communities can cause the attention of a broader audience, and this can cause virality. This result suggests that the spreading of an idea can be boosted up if that opinion implants in these communities and these communities adopt the idea.",

This suggests an absolute limitation to the predictability of missing linksin real networks, due to the irreducible uncertainty arising from the random nature of link formation processes.We show that a predictability limit can be estimated in real networks, and we propose a method to approximatesuch a bound from real-world networks with missing links.

However, increasing the number of cells increases the rate of required handover as a mobile user passes through the boundaries of these cells leads to more signaling overhead. We address the impact of mobile users’ mobility model in the urban areas on the handover rate. We use two real data sets to model the mobility pattern of pedestrians and drivers, considering their different velocity, move length, and pause time distributions. We use Poisson Point Processes to model the spatial distribution of base stations and assume that the number of handovers is equal to the number of times the users’ trajectories cross the cell's boundaries. We derive the distribution function of the handover rate by using the distribution function of the velocity of users. Simulation results are provided to justify the deployed mobility model and the derived analytical results for the handover rate. We find that while the trend of the handover rate against the density of base stations and bias values at different tiers deploying the derived realistic mobility models and simple random waypoint model is the same, the total number of handovers in the network has different behavior. Interestingly, we found that if the number of users increases beyond a threshold, the handover rate decreases, suggesting that the hand over rate is bounded.",

In this paper, we discuss the impacts of the cooperation range on the detection delay and accuracy and then conclude that there is an optimal amount for cooperation range which maximizes detection accuracy. We then derive the optimal cooperative range that improves the detection accuracy by using network parameters such as FBS's transmission power, noise power, shadowing fading factor, and path-loss exponent and investigate the impacts of these parameters on the optimal cooperative range.

Current solutions for resolving MTC Devices (MTCDs) collisions in the LTE incur additional overhead to existing MTCDs which may not be efficient for cost-effective MTCDs. Also, the lack of proper Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) management scheme may waste a large number of PRBs and leads to poor RA performance upon massive access of MTCDs. To this end, a simple PRBs management scheme based on the early preamble collision detection is proposed in this paper to improve the RA throughput of massive MTC. By exploiting the pool of RA resources and upon collision detection, a proper number of PRBs is granted to each collided preamble by estimating the number of collided MTCDs. To sustain the number of consumed PRBs around a certain threshold, the number of contending MTCDs is regulated using an appropriate Access Class Barring (ACB) factor. Simulation results show that the RA throughput and average RA delay can be improved using the proposed solution compared to the previous schemes; while the expected number of consumed PRBs in each RA procedure is sustained below a certain threshold.",

      "abstract": "Primary User Emulation (PUE) attack is one of the serious attacks in the cognitive radio networks, which could cause the denial of service (DOS) in the secondary networks. In this article, assuming one attacker in the network and in the lack of a central management unit, a distributed scheme based on the uncoordinated frequency hopping technique is proposed to defense against the PUE attack. This scheme consists of two phases. In the synchronization phase, the secondary user (SU) tries to synchronize with its receiver by sending a random pattern in the licensed channels while the attacker tries to prevent the SU from using these channels. In the data-sending phase, the SU sends its data according to the random pattern in the presence of the PUE attacker. In this scheme, the SU can re-sense the selected channel for reducing the effects of the attacker on the overhead of the synchronization phase. The synchronization phase is modeled by a non-zero-sum game between the SU (defender) and attacker. The relevant strategies are then extracted for each player and the Nash equilibrium point of this game is obtained with the game theory analysis. Numerical simulations demonstrated the correctness of the extracted Nash equilibrium point and improvement of the SU throughput in the presence of a PUE attacker.",

In CARA, the evolved Node B exploits early collision detection of preambles at the first message and informs the MTCDs in the corresponding random access response (RAR) message if it can detect the collision successfully.

A Markov-modulated Poisson process and an approximated coupled Markov-modulated Poisson process are adopted for modeling the uncoordinated and coordinated M2M network traffic, respectively. Moreover, fixed-access grant time interval algorithm is used as a low-overhead cluster–based scheduling algorithm to serve packets. Using some approximations, we first derive analytical results for the delay violation and packet loss probabilities of M2M traffic in Long-Term Evolution networks in different scenarios. We then investigate the effect of buffer size on the quality of service of M2M user equipments. Specifically, in contrast to uncoordinated traffic model, it is shown that for the coordinated traffic model increasing the buffer size above a threshold is not effective in decreasing the loss probability of user equipments.

Overload in the RAN and CN of the LTE may result in congestion occurrence, resource waste, Quality of Service (QoS) degradation and in the worst-case, it will cause service unavailability. In this paper, we have proposed an adaptive mechanism to manage a large number of MTC devices in both RAN and CN of the LTE network. We use Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme to regulate the MTC traffic according to the congestions level in the RAN and CN. We consider a scenario in which two-priority-based classes of MTC devices are contending for the RAN resources. At first, the overload problem in the RAN is formulated to find the number of allowable contending MTC devices of each class taking into account their required QoS. Then, an active load management policy based on additive increase multiplicative decrease rule is proposed to control the incoming load from multiple cells to the CN. To effectively limit the number of MTC devices in both RAN and CN, in the proposed approach, each Evolved Node B updates the ACB factor upon overload detection in the RAN or CN in an adaptive manner. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is able to manage overload in the CN and RAN simultaneously.",

We present a multiple data packets transmission scheme based on the Access Class Barring (ACB) and multiple granted Resource Blocks (RBs) to further reduce the MTC Devices’ (MTCDs’) energy consumption. In the proposed scheme, each MTCD stays in the idle state until its queue builds up to u data packets which then called an active MTCD. Next, active MTCDs initiate the ACB check which allows the successful ones to transmit u data packet simultaneously in one RA procedure and hence reduces the energy consumption. That is by granting a greater number of RBs for each detected preamble and at the cost of longer access delay more energy could be saved. Using queueing theory analysis, we analyze the RA efficiency and the trade-off between energy consumption and incurred access delay of RA for a given number of RBs.

Each SU is empowered with an LA which operates in the RF environment with different responses.

Using these responses, SUs control their accesses to the channels for appropriate spectrum management with the objective to incur less communication delay, less interference with PUs, and less interference with other SUs.

      "abstract": "Access control is an effective way to protect the radio access part of Long-Term Evolution–Advanced (LTE-A) network from the overload caused by a huge number of Machine-Type Communication Devices (MTCDs). A class of access control mechanisms is the Access Class Barring (ACB), which regulates the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) traffic in accordance with the available Random Access (RA) resources. In this paper, we extend the single power level ACB scheme to a multiple power level method to increase the number of successfully transmitted requests in the case of overload. Our analysis is based on the capture effect in the third step of RA procedure of the LTE-A system in which one of the transmitted requests by 2 or more co-tagged MTCDs, MTCDs which use the same preamble in the first step, can be decoded by the evolved–Node B (eNB). We first formulate the power level selection as an optimization problem assuming the perfect capture model without considering MTCDs' energy budget. Then, to take into account MTCDs' energy consumption, the scenario is extended for the signal-to-interference ratio–based capture model. In addition, we investigate the advantages of the proposed multiple power level RA method on discriminating the access of MTCDs with different priorities. The numerical results show that using the optimal parameters, the RA throughput can be improved in comparison with the single power level system at the cost of slightly increasing MTCDs' energy consumption and the complexity of RA procedure.",

Due to the upload bandwidth bottleneck of VoD servers, the streaming capacity in the P2P-VoD system is limited. This paper proposes a new mechanism to improve the video streaming in P2P networks by using the idle peers upload bandwidth and storage, which are called helpers. The proposed method uses an XOR mechanism in the VoD server to encode chunks and reduce bandwidth use. The helpers receive encoded chunks from the VoD server and save them in their storage spaces and cooperate in sharing these chunks with the other peers. Simulation results using OMNET++ are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in terms of the required upload capacity requirement of the server and deploying the storage and bandwidth of helpers. The results of simulation show that the upload bandwidth usage of the server has been reduced. On the other hand, the proposed method increases the memory usage of helpers.",

Besides, the required inter-cluster communications in these networks may lead to imbalanced energy consumption among cluster-heads that in turn decreases the network lifetime. In this paper, a gradient-based clustering algorithm for energy-efficient routing (GCER) in wireless sensor networks is proposed. The main idea is based on partitioning the sensing region in such a way that the total energy consumption of the network is minimized. The algorithm uses unequal clustering structure which balances the energy consumption among the cluster-heads and lessens the effect of hotspot problem. Furthermore, a distributed protocol for choosing cluster-heads and routing is deployed to balance the energy among all sensor nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme balances the energy consumption among the cluster-heads and increases the network lifetime compared to some recent reported clustering schemes in the literature.",

We propose an optimization framework based on binary integer programming that minimizes interference in multicast communication. Our Multicasting with multiple Gateways and Partially Overlapped Channels (MG-POC) framework utilizes a rational node selection to construct multicast tree that increases network performance. MG-POC is efficient as it (1) constructs the paths between source and receivers with minimal number of data forwarding nodes; (2) employs multiple gateways to substantially reduce interference and usage of resources; (3) benefits from wireless broadcast advantage and partially overlapped channels in channel assignment; (4) solves channel assignment and tree construction problems simultaneously. A weakly decoupled approach is also presented which finds a nearly optimal solution for large network problems in a reasonably short amount of time. Our schemes are proved to offer a connected and loop-free tree; and their performance are well compared to that of several existing methods on different simulation scenarios. The results of our simulations also demonstrate that incorporating multi-gateway and partially overlapping channels has a significant impact on minimizing network interference which, in turn, dramatically enhances network throughput.",

Formulating the problem in the state space, we deploy particle filtering for denoising the erroneous MVs. The main challenge of using particle filters is high computational complexity that is directly related to the number of particles. The proposed particle filtering scheme is efficient even if the number of particles is decreased. Experimental results are provided to show the efficiency of this filtering approach compared to a recent scheme based on Kalman filtering. The experiments show meaningful increase in the quality of the recovered video sequences in terms of PSNR up to 3 dB compared with the other error concealment techniques.

The objective is to minimize the spectrum access time of Secondary Users (SUs) which are competing for spectrum opportunities in heterogeneous environment. In this paper, the preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queuing model is used to characterize the multiple handoff and data delivery time of SUs. Also an explicit solution for channels selection probabilities of each SU is extracted for PRP M/M/1 model specifically. The effect of handoffs is considered as the interrupted packets which return to the SUs’ low priority queue when the high priority Primary User’s packets are arrived to take service. The queuing delay of SUs’ and the effect of these returned packets are considered in order to balance the load of SUs on channels so that the minimum spectrum access time is sensed by each SU. The non-cooperative spectrum load balancing with handoff management game is proposed to find a distributed solution for each SU. It is shown that this game has a unique Nash equilibrium point which can be achieved by SUs as decision makers. At this equilibrium, each SU incurs the minimum delay on all channels while the free spectrum holes of channels are utilized efficiently. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of spectrum access delay, fairness, and channels spectrum holes utilization.",

Several approaches have been proposed to relieve the massive access by time barring or time distributing of access requesting. In virtual-frame technique the requests are spread in consecutive frames to increase the successful accesses. The length of virtual-frame, the number of LTE uplink frames which are concatenated for managing the random access of M2M requests, should be selected appropriately according to the network load to compromise the successful access rate and the incurred delay of each access. In this paper, we propose an adaptive scheme by which the eNB is able to find the length of the virtual-frame dynamically and broadcasts this information at the end of each virtual-frame. We use an online load estimation technique to adjust the length of virtual-frame. Simulation results show that using this scheme the length of virtual-frame is just increased when the access network load is high which prevents unnecessary delays for lightly loaded conditions.",

The authors propose an iterative scheme in which MeNB and HeNBs make decisions autonomously. The MeNB as the spectrum provider decides on the unit-bandwidth price with the objective to maximise its revenue. Each HeNB, on the other side, decides on the amount of requested bandwidth as well as the number of possible nearby macro-users which will support to take advantage of MeNB discounting. The designed discounting strategy is applied for the extra bandwidth request of HeNBs to encourage them in supporting nearby macro-users. It is shown analytically that the proposed scheme converges to a unique Nash equilibrium which is Pareto optimal. Evaluating the authors' game through different simulations demonstrates that it is all beneficial for both MeNB and HeNBs and the social welfare is maximised in the network.",

In this paper, the rate of handoff occurrence is investigated and the preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queuing model is used to characterized the multiple handoff and data delivery time of SU. In this paper, when spectrum handoff occurs during the transmission of a SU's packet, the SU stops the transmission and this packet takes the higher priority rather than other SU's packets and when the PU's transmission is finished, this interrupted packet has higher priority to transmit. In fact, there are three classes of priority in this model. The highest priority is for PU's packets, the next priority is for interrupted packets, and the last priority is for normal packets of SU. In fact, the second priority queue is a feedback queue that interrupted packets return to this queue. In order to support the stability conditions of the system, by considering the effect of multiple interruptions on data delivery time of SUs, we study the stability region for arrival rate of SUs in this paper. The simulation results show the rate of handoff occurrence based on analytical and simulation results, and also show the stability region for SU's arrival rate considering handoff effects.",

The selected distance function to measure the similarity and dissimilarity of sessions' features affect the performance of clustering based IDSs. The most popular distance metric, which is used in designing these IDSs is the Euclidean distance function. In this paper, we argue that more appropriate distance functions can be deployed for IDSs. We propose a method of learning an appropriate distance function according to a set of supervision information. This metric is derived by solving a semi-definite optimization problem, which attempts to decrease the distance between the similar, and increases the distances between the dissimilar feature vectors. The evaluation of this scheme over Kyoto2006+ dataset shows that the new distance metric, can improve the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) clustering based IDS in terms of normal detection and false positive rates.",

This situation is employed at the physical layer under the conditions of non-saturated traffic and finite-length queue at the data link layer. First, a model of a two-hop EF relaying wireless channel is proposed as an equivalent extend multi-dimensional Markovian state transition model in queuing analysis. Then, the performance in terms of queuing delay, throughput and packet loss rate are derived. We provide closed-form expressions for the delay and throughput of two-hop unbalanced bidirectional traffic cases both with and without network coding. We consider the buffers on nodes are unsaturated. The analytical results are mainly derived by solving queuing systems for the buffer behavior at the relay node. To overcome the hidden node problem in multi hop wireless networks, we develop a useful mathematical model.

We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem in which the proposed cost function for secondary users considers the quality, price and handoff cost of the selected channel. This type of pricing scheme not only manages the cost, but also avoids the secondary users from all selecting the same set of channels; hence reduces the congestion in high quality channels. The target channel for handoff is selected according to the spatial contention between secondary users. This target channel has the minimum cost in terms of congestion level, financial cost and switching probability.

We consider single and multiple secondary user scenarios. In the first scenario, the secondary user deploys learning automata to estimate the primary channel availability probability for efficient exploitation. In the second scenario, each secondary user deploys an algorithm based on MRLA to estimate primary traffic as well as the behavior of other secondary users in order to control the rate of collisions. Then, to have a better control on the rate of secondary collisions, when the number of secondary users is greater than the number of primary channels, we proposed an admission control scheme. In this scheme, some of secondary users are blocked in each time slot and do not have any interaction with the environment. The convergence of the proposed algorithms with and without admission schemes is analyzed.

We show that the developed receiver-receiver scheme outperforms the classic liner regression based protocols in terms of synchronization accuracy by analysis.

In these networks secondary users try to coexist with primary ones. We consider a data communication scenario in which utility obtained by a user measures its quality of service (QoS). This utility is quantified based on success of the user for correct transmission of information bits. To provide primary users protection, a threshold tolerable interference is determined for them. Therefore, transmit powers of secondary users should be controlled in a way that the aggregate interferences for primary users are not exceeded from the predefined extent. A utility-based joint power and admission control (U-JPAC) algorithm is presented for data networks, in order to allocate radio resources in an efficient manner to the requesting links, while the interference constraints are not violated and considering the total utility of secondary users as the objective. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently in maximizing total utility of cognitive data networks considering primary users protection compared to the similar previous algorithm. However, a small outage increment is occurred in some conditions. It is illustrated by simulation results that U-JPAC algorithm is efficient in both single and multiple primary user scenarios.",

Assuming physical model for successful transmission, a tractable formula for link throughput as a function of link attempt rate and power vectors is derived. Considering the effect of self-interference in analysis, an algorithm for adjusting the sessions rate and links state, i.e., links attempt rate and power, is derived. Sessions rate and links state are coordinated by congestion signals feedback to sources and messages broadcasted by links respectively. Analysis and simulation results show that adjusting the link state can mitigate the interference and improve the utilization of network resources. Also, it is shown that for a given link at the equilibrium, the link state should be adjusted on the basis of the link location in the network.

Considering a utility function for each terminal, the purpose of power control in wireless data networks is to maximize network utility. In the proposed game, the pricing function is a linear function of the terminal's Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR). We first prove that the new game is a supermodular game and then we show the strategy space of the new game is such that it is possible to reach better equilibrium point compared to pricing function based on terminal's power. Simulation results show that the game with the proposed pricing function can improve the utility and power consumption of the terminals at equilibrium.",

The proposed algorithm is a cross layer algorithm considering power control at the physical layer, attempt rate control at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer and rate control at the transport layer of the network. The optimization variables are coordinated through two shadow prices. The first one regulates each session rate to the throughput of the links in its path, and the second one controls the attempt rates to meet maximal clique capacity constraint. Considering a model for successful transmission, the excitatory and inhibitory factors affecting each variable are derived.

The problem is formulated as a cross layer network utility maximization problem that considers the interaction of transport, MAC and physical layers in the protocol stack. Assuming physical model for successful transmission, a tractable formula for link throughput as a function of link attempt rate and power vectors is derived. Solving the problem, an algorithm for adjusting the session rate and link state i.e. link attempt rate and power, is proposed. At the session source, the algorithm adjusts the rate of the session based on the congestion signals feedback from the links in its path. At the links, the algorithm adjusts link state, based on the link congestion measure and messages received from neighboring links. Simulation results show that for a given link and at equilibrium the link state should be adjusted based on the link location in the network. This result is consistence with previous results that emphasize in MHWN, MAC should be designed by considering both time and space contention between links.",

Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.Clinical relevance - This study proposes balancing the spectral, temporal and spatial feature resolution to improve EEGbased diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.",

This concept was previously adapted to graph structures, whereby heat flows between nodes of a graph depending on the graph topology. Here, we combine the graph heat equation with the stochastic heat equation, which ultimately yields a model for multivariate time signals on a graph. We show theoretically how the model can be used to directly compute the diffusion-based connectivity structure from multivariate signals. Unlike other connectivity measures, our heat model-based approach is inherently multivariate and yields an absolute scaling factor, namely the graph thermal diffusivity, which captures the extent of heat-like graph propagation in the data. On two datasets, we show how the graph thermal diffusivity can be used to characterise Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We find that the graph thermal diffusivity is lower for AD patients than healthy controls and correlates with mini–mental state examination (MMSE) scores, suggesting structural impairment in patients in line with previous findings.Clinical relevance— This study introduces a novel heat-based connectivity measure, which allows to characterise Alzheimer’s disease in terms of the graph thermal diffusivity.",

The emerging field of graph signal processing (GSP) promises to analyse spectral characteristics of these multivariate signals, while also taking the spatial structure between the time signals into account. A core idea in GSP is the graph Fourier transform, which projects a multivariate signal onto frequency-ordered graph Fourier modes and can be regarded as a spatial analogue of the classical Fourier transform. This chapter derives and discusses key concepts in GSP, with a specific focus on understanding the differences between parallel formulations and the interconnections between the various concepts. The experimental section focuses on the role of graph frequency in data classification, with applications to neuroimaging. To shed light on graph frequencies individually, sample sizes larger than those of relevant empirical data sets are needed. We therefore introduce a minimalist simulation to generate sufficiently many signals, which share key characteristics with neurophysiological signals. Using this artificial data, we find that higher graph frequency signals are more suitable for classification as compared to lower graph frequency signals and propose GSP mechanisms to explain our findings. Finally, we present a baseline testing framework for GSP. Using this framework, our results suggest that GSP may be applicable for dimensionality reduction in neurophysiological signals.",

These temporal signals are generally not independent of each other, but exhibit a rich spatial structure. Graph filtering, either spatial or spectral, is a method that can leverage this spatial structure for various preprocessing tasks, such as graph denoising. Previous studies have focused on learning the parameters of spatial graph impulse response (GIR) filters, while neglecting spectral graph frequency response (GFR) filters, even though GFR filters offer unique advantages in terms of regularisation and interpretation. In this study, we therefore compare learning GIR filters and GFR filters as a trainable preprocessing step for two different neural networks on an Alzheimer’s classification task. We tested both a functional connectivity graph as well as a geometric graph as the base of each filter type, and varied the localisation of the spatial filter. As expected, the retrieved shapes of the trained filters suggest that GFR filters can be interpreted in terms of their graph structure, while the same does not hold for GIR filters. Contrarily, however, we found that only the geometric, highly localised GIR filter outperforms the baseline significantly, surpassing it by 3.8 percentage points. These findings suggest that the observed performance boost of a trained localised GIR filter may in fact not be due to the graph structure. Instead, we hypothesise that this boost is caused by favourable algebraic properties of the filter matrix.",

Selecting important EEG channels is crucial for reducing computational complexity in implementing these methods and improving classification accuracy. In neuroscience, measures of (dis) similarity between EEG channels are often used as functional connectivity (FC) features, and important channels are selected via feature selection. Developing a generic measure of (dis) similarity is important for FC analysis and channel selection. In this study, learning of (dis) similarity information within the EEG is achieved using kernel-based nonlinear manifold learning. The focus is on FC changes and, thereby, EEG channel selection. Isomap and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (Isomap-GPLVM) are employed for this purpose. The resulting kernel (dis) similarity matrix is used as a novel measure of linear and nonlinear FC between EEG channels. The analysis of EEG from healthy controls (HC) and patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) are presented as a case study. Classification results are compared with other commonly used FC measures. Our analysis shows significant differences in FC between bipolar channels of the occipital region and other regions (i.e. parietal, centro-parietal, and fronto-central) between AD and HC groups. Furthermore, our results indicate that FC changes between channels along the fronto-parietal region and the rest of the EEG are important in diagnosing AD. Our results and its relation to functional networks are consistent with those obtained from previous studies using fMRI, resting-state fMRI and EEG.",

The Nonlinear Output Frequency Response Functions (NOFRFs) of the nonlinear rotor-bearing system are evaluated and used to diagnosis the abnormal conditions of the bearings. Both simulation and experimental studies are conducted to demonstrate the application of the NOFRFs based fault detection method. The results indicate that the higher order NOFRFs are sensitive to the faults of the bearings and independent of the imbalance distance of the rotor. The monotonous change of the NOFRFs with the severity of the faults can be used to effectively quantify the severities of defects in the rotor-bearing systems.",

      "year": "2018",
      "abstract": "Nonlinear behavior has been exploited over the last decade towards improving the efficiency of most engineering systems. The effect of nonlinearities on a vibration energy harvester (VEH) has been widely studied. It has been reported in literature that a cubic damping nonlinearity extends the dynamic range (power/energy level) of a VEH system. It has also been widely shown that the operational bandwidth of a VEH system can be increased using a nonlinear hardening spring. As most energy harvesters have a maximum throw limited by the physical enclosure of the device, it is imperative to improve the operational conditions of the harvester within this limitation. This paper investigates the effects of a nonlinear hardening spring with cubic damping on a VEH system while assuming no limitation to the maximum throw (Practical VEH systems are constrained to a maximum throw and this is considered in a subsequent study). A frequency-based approach known as Output Frequency Response Function (OFRF) determined using the Associated Linear Equations (ALEs) of the nonlinear system model is employed. The OFRF polynomial is a representation of the actual system model hence used for the nonlinear VEH analysis and design. Based on the OFRF, optimal parameter values are designed to achieve any desired level of energy for the VEH.",

In 2002, legal policy was amended to emphasize children's religion, race, and culture in finding permanent homes. However, in 2014 the legal requirement to consider ethnicity was removed, allowing transracial placements. Many frontline social workers did not agree with this change, arguing that by removing ethnicity, the law devalued the significance of ethnicity to individual children’s identity.

There are more than 4500 Muslim-heritage children in the UK who cannot live with their biological families. For some of these children, ethnically and religiously matched homes can lead to more secure futures; however, there is a shortage of Muslim-heritage carers. This article examines the reasons for the lack of Muslim-heritage adopters or foster carers in the UK by combining understandings from Islamic religious texts, contemporary British social work practice, and sociological analysis of children's experiences. The empirical findings presented here are based on semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 41) with various professionals and carers involved in the care of Muslim-heritage children. Our evidence uncovers specific socio-cultural, political and theological barriers that hinder carers of Muslim backgrounds from coming forward to adopt or foster. By better understanding these barriers, this article provides an evidence base to inform social work policy and practice to enhance recruitment of carers from Muslim backgrounds. The data presented in the paper also contributes to raising awareness within Social Work practice and Muslim communities around the needs of vulnerable children, to improve their life outcomes.",

      "year": "2024",
      "abstract": "Despite the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks, the practical application of these frameworks in industrial settings remains limited. This limitation is further augmented in energy systems by the complexity of systems composition and systems operation for energy generation, distribution, and supply. The primary reason for this limitation is the gap between the conceptual notion of ethics principles and the technical performance of AI applications in energy systems. For instance, trust is featured prominently in ethics frameworks but pertains to limited relevance for the robust operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we propose a lifecycle approach for AI ethics that aims to address this gap. The proposed approach consists of four phases: design, development, operation, and evaluation. All four phases are supported by a central AI ethics repository that gathers and integrates the primary and secondary dimensions of ethical practice, including reliability, safety, and trustworthiness, from design through to evaluation. This lifecycle approach is closely aligned with the operational lifecycle of energy systems, from design and production through to use, maintenance, repair, and overhaul, followed by shutdown, recycling, and replacement. Across these lifecycle stages, an energy system engages with numerous human stakeholders, directly with designers, engineers, users, trainers, operators, and maintenance technicians, as well as indirectly with managers, owners, policymakers, and community groups. This lifecycle approach is empirically evaluated in the complex energy system of a multi-campus tertiary education institution where the alignment between ethics and technical performance, as well as the human-centric application of AI, are demonstrated.",

Through their narratives, we understand how children in care experience and perceive their identities, as well as their understandings of the care that they receive and desire for their identities.We rely on children’s and young people’s voices and stories. Using an intersectional approach, we worked with Black, Asian and mixed-heritage children and young people (aged 14 to 19) to understand their narratives of identity. We focused firstly on understandings of ethnicity and religion and how these change in relation to other aspects of identity and, crucially, by being in care. Secondly, we examined their experiences of asking and getting help from social workers, foster carers, adopters and other support structures that provide for their identities while in care.By listening to and understanding children and young people’s perspectives around ethnicity, religion and identity, we developed a new framework to inform both theoretical and practical work with children in care. We describe our model as Identities in-Flux, which integrates Kimberlé Crenshaw’s Intersectionality and Meredith McGuires’ Lived Religion theories to generate new frameworks of reference that support best practice when implementing support plans for young people and children. Within this model, we consider the interplay of changing socio-ethnic-religious factors, as well as young people and children’s biological heritage, their being in care and their own agency in determining how they themselves want to be perceived. By broadening discussion from a singular focus on one aspect of identity, such as race or gender, we hope to support inclusive and sensitive practices and policies that reflect and respond to the increasing diversity of children and young people entering care.",

In addition to increased exposure and risk of sexual violence, displaced women and young girls must contend with inequality in accessing information, decision-making and economic opportunities at local and governmental levels. Energy interventions can be instrumental in reducing inequities, but energy use and access is also highly gendered in the displaced context. Drawing upon empirical research of the experiences of Congolese refugees in Rwanda and internally displaced people in Nepal, this chapter will explore to what extent improved energy access benefits men and women equally.

Within this dialogue, young people’s voices and lived experience are needed to deepen the impact of energy policy intervention strategies. This article stresses the importance of a formal curriculum that informs future generations on the subjects of Smart Local Energy Systems (SLES), and the digitalisation advances of energy systems. This paper explores the development of a toolkit to educate and engage young people in these subjects, and reviews young people’s attitudes and understanding from three schools in England, UK. We find through an interpretive qualitative analysis of both images drawn by the young people, and insights gathered from focus groups, that i) for these young people, SLES are a useful innovation regarding energy management and distribution, ii) young people recognise that the education system as it currently stands is not aware of, or informed by smart energy technologies and iii) that despite being a generation that is the most integrated with personal assistance technology, these young people have significant concerns over the reliability and safety of AI in SLES. These findings are set alongside calls for widespread education in key stages 4 and 5 (ages 14-18) around the subject of SLES, and their benefits to wider society, thereby enabling a future that empowers young people to make change, encourage engineering and computer science-based career options and secure a fairer, cleaner, sustainable energy transition in the future.",

This article interrogates the impact of the change in law on social work practice around adoption, using the experiences of diverse Muslim-heritage children as a case study. Grounded in the sociology of religion, the findings presented here are based on semi-structured qualitative interviews (n=28) with those involved in the care of Muslim-heritage children. In discussing qualitative findings, all adopters and prospective adopters interviewed in this research insisted on adopting children who 'look like them', and social workers continued to look for the 'best' possible matches. Children from minoritised backgrounds continue to wait for long periods before finding permanent homes. Our evidence raises questions about the efficacy of policy guidance. Based on this evidence we conclude that greater strategizing is needed around the recruitment of adopters from diverse backgrounds.",

      "abstract": "All children need permanent and secure homes in which they can explore their identities and evolve as human beings, citizens, and family members, and within which can they have a sense of security, continuity, stability, and belonging. There are approximately 4500 children of Muslim heritage in the care system in England and Wales, and this number is increasing. Using case studies that emerged from qualitative fieldwork, this article examines the role and impact of religion on children’s journeys through the care system, particularly in foster care. This article concludes that irrespective of the level of engagement Muslim heritage children in the care system have with their religious heritage, Islam has an enduring impact on how they perceive their identities. As a result, there is a pressing need for social workers and foster carers who care for these children to gain greater insights into Islam and Muslim culture. Such insights and understandings will help children settle faster and form stronger bonds of attachment with their foster carers, and in the long term, this will enhance life outcomes for these children.",

      "abstract": "In October 2018, the Prophet Russell M. Nelson informed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that the Church teaching curriculum would shift focus away from lessons taught on Sunday. Instead, members were now asked to engage with ‘home-centred, church-supported’ religious instruction using the Church materials ‘Come, Follow Me’. In a religion where Church leaders still defend the idealised family structure of a stay-at-home mother and a father as the provider, the renewed emphasis on the domestic sphere as the site for Church teaching could also reinforce traditional Mormon gender roles. This article draws upon the lived religion of Latter-day Saint women in Sweden, Greece and England to understand how they negotiate gender in their homes. Looking at the implementation of ‘Come, Follow Me’ of sacralising of the home as a gendered practice, there appears to be reinforcing the primacy of the domestic space in the reproduction of religious practices and doctrinal instruction. Simultaneously, in conceptualising a gender role, the guardian of the family, I show the ways that European Latter-day Saint women are providing, protecting and nurturing their families. The domestic space then becomes instrumental in providing space for more nuanced, complex gender constructs that accommodate Mormon beliefs, cultural context and secular notions of gender without destabilising the institutional structure.",

In some cases, they may never find a permanent home at all. Such delays cause lasting harm for children and according to Selwyn et al, ‘delay in decision making and action has an unacceptable price in terms of the reduction in children’s life chances and the financial costs to local authorities, the emotional and financial burden later placed on adoptive families and future costs to society’ (2006). Policy makers’ response has been to emphasise transracial placements so that the process of finding a permanent home is expedited for these children.Through interviews with social workers, foster carers, adoptive parents and prospective adoptive parents, this research presents a research-informed narrative of the complexities in Muslim children’s circumstances and identities, which influence how decisions are made about their lives. By better understanding the journeys of these children through the care system, this research will provide an evidence base for practitioners, policy makers and communities to draw upon, and in doing so will improve outcomes for these children, their families and for society as a whole.This research provides strong evidence of the salience of Islam to Muslim children’s identities. When children come into care they experience upheaval, displacement and trauma – in such contexts faith is familiar and enables children to be resilient. If in their new home, children’s faith and ethnic needs are provided, they are happier, are more settled and attach better and sooner to their carers. Foster carers and adopters agree that faith is central to their identities too, that faith motivates them to care for the children they look after and that they may be ",

      "abstract": "Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia, is a progres-sive brain disorder that disrupts memory, thinking, and behavior, with early diagnosis being critical for effective intervention. This study examines the alteration of brain activity caused by dementia by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using an infor- mation geometry method known as information rate, which captures the evolving pat- terns of brain signals over time rather than relying on static averages. This method is applied across standard EEG frequency bands – delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma– in participants with dementia and healthy controls. The characteristics of the distribu- tion of information rate are studied through the statistical moments (such as mean, vari- ance, skewness, and kurtosis) and Shannon entropy. The statistical comparisons are accessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc analysis, and results are compared against a conventional average-base method using Jensen-Shannon distance. The results show that dynamic features of EEG signals – particularly in the theta, alpha, and beta bands – effectively distinguish Alzheimer’s patients from healthy individuals, while the Shannon entropy of signal dynamics in frontal region differentiates frontotem- poral dementia patients across the theta to gamma bands. Moreover, changes in the occipital region detected by information rate, but not by traditional method, further high- light the importance of capturing temporal variability. The method also successfully dis- tinguishes individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment from healthy controls, which con- ventional analysis failed to achieve. These results suggest that analyzing the dynamics properties of the brain signals provides a more sensitive and informative approach for identifying and distinguishing various forms of dementia.",

We exhaustively search the published literature on this topic and derive several categories for comparison. These categories highlight the similarities and differences among the methods. The results suggest a prevalence of spectral graph convolutional layers over spatial. Additionally, we identify standard forms of node features, with the most popular being the raw EEG signal and differential entropy. Our results summarise the emerging trends in GNN-based approaches for EEG classification. Finally, we discuss several promising research directions, such as exploring the potential of transfer learning methods and appropriate modelling of cross-frequency interactions.",

In particular, we employ information rates to quantify the time evolution of probability density functions of simulated EEG signals, and employ causal information rates to quantify one signal’s instantaneous influence on another signal’s information rate. These two measures help us find significant and interesting distinctions between healthy subjects and AD patients when they change their eyes’ open/closed status. These distinctions may be further related to differences in neural information processing activities of the corresponding brain regions, and to differences in connectivities among these brain regions. In particular, a prominent distinction is that, when healthy subjects open their eyes, there is a directional change in net causal connectivities among brain regions (that generate EEG signals modeled by stochastic nonlinear coupled oscillators), as measured by net causal information rates, whereas this directional change in net causality does not present when AD patients open their eyes. Since these information geometry theoretic measures can be applied to experimental EEG signals in a modelfree manner, and they are capable of quantifying non-stationary time-varying effects, nonlinearity, and non-Gaussian stochasticity presented in real-world EEG signals, we believe that they can form an important and powerful tool-set for both understanding neural information processing in the brain and diagnosis of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease.",

After establishing suitable ranges through a comprehensive literature review, these properties varied within those ranges. Compared to white light, a 16-h cycle of blue light reduces DTF and hypocotyl length by 12 % and 3 %, respectively. Interestingly, similar results can be achieved using a shorter photoperiod of 14-h light (composed of 8 h of a mixture of 66.7 μmol m-2s-1 red and 800 μmol m-2s-1 blue lights (i.e. blue:red ratio of 12:1) followed by 6 h of monochromatic red light and 10-h dark.

To ensure a low total operational cost and improve the efficiency of farming in those environments, it is imperative that the overall LED lighting system is energy efficient. LED is a dc system, whereas the grid is an ac system. As such, an LED driver is needed to perform the necessary voltage conversion. The boost power factor correction (PFC) converter is a popular LED driver that provides output voltage regulation and power factor correction at the same time. As the LED driver is grid-connected, its control system requires real-time estimation of the grid voltage parameter information for reference current generation. In this study, a comparison between frequency-and phase-locked loops as the grid detection method inside the converter control system is provided. For the phase-locked loop (PLL), a single-phase quasi-type-1 structure is considered. It is then compared with the conventional second-order generalised integrator (SOGI)frequency-locked loop (FLL). Comprehensive numerical studies are performed to evaluate the performance of FLL and PLL in challenging grid voltage cases. Results show that the source current has a lower total harmonic distortion when PLL is used as the synchronisation tool over the FLL counterpart. This can be attributed to the use of moving average filter in the PLL, which provides additional harmonic robustness compared to FLL. Lower distortion by the PLL method will the make LED driver, consequently smart farming more energy efficient.",

      "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) models are increasingly being used for the classification of electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, GNN-based diagnosis of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), remains a relatively unexplored area of research. Previous studies have relied on functional connectivity methods to infer brain graph structures and used simple GNN architectures for the diagnosis of AD. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive gated graph convolutional network (AGGCN) that can provide explainable predictions. AGGCN adaptively learns graph structures by combining convolution-based node feature enhancement with a correlation-based measure of power spectral density similarity. Furthermore, the gated graph convolution can dynamically weigh the contribution of various spatial scales. The proposed model achieves high accuracy in both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions, indicating the stability of learned representations. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed AGGCN model generates consistent explanations of its predictions that might be relevant for further study of AD-related alterations of brain networks.",

In speed breeding, typically various light qualities (e.g., colour, duration, intensity) are modified to manipulate the circadian clock of the plants, which in turn alter the plant growth and enhance the productivity such as by reducing the flowering time. In order to develop a comprehensive framework describing plant growth, a model incorporating the effect of various light qualities on plant growth needs to be established. Recently a mathematical model of the plant circadian clock for Arabidopsis thaliana has been developed to characterise the hypocotyl growth subject to multiple light quality properties. This is a first step towards developing a more comprehensive model that links light quality, plant circadian clock and plant growth. In this work, we extend the model by adding the effect of various light qualities on the flowering time. The proposed model can capture the flowering time behaviours of plant when subject to red, blue, and mixed lights and can be used to guide experiment of light properties manipulation for optimised plant growth via hypocotyl growth and flowering time.",

      "abstract": "The quantification of causality is vital for understanding various important phenomena in nature and laboratories, such as brain networks, environmental dynamics, and pathologies. The two most widely used methods for measuring causality are Granger Causality (GC) and Transfer Entropy (TE), which rely on measuring the improvement in the prediction of one process based on the knowledge of another process at an earlier time. However, they have their own limitations, e.g., in applications to nonlinear, non-stationary data, or non-parametric models. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to quantify causality through information geometry that overcomes such limitations. Specifically, based on the information rate that measures the rate of change of the time-dependent distribution, we develop a model-free approach called information rate causality that captures the occurrence of the causality based on the change in the distribution of one process caused by another. This measurement is suitable for analyzing numerically generated non-stationary, nonlinear data. The latter are generated by simulating different types of discrete autoregressive models which contain linear and nonlinear interactions in unidirectional and bidirectional time-series signals. Our results show that information rate causality can capture the coupling of both linear and nonlinear data better than GC and TE in the several examples explored in the paper.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder known to affect functional connectivity (FC) across many brain regions. Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation from each other. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis approach, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. This work reports the reconstruction of a cross-frequency FC network where each frequency band is treated as a layer in a multilayer network with both inter- and intra-layer edges. Cross-bispectrum detects cross-frequency differences, mainly increased FC in AD cases in δ-θ coupling. Overall, increased strength of low-frequency coupling and decreased level of high-frequency coupling is observed in AD cases in comparison to healthy controls (HC). We demonstrate that a graph-theoretic analysis of cross-frequency brain networks is crucial to obtain a more detailed insight into their structure and function. Vulnerability analysis reveals that the integration and segregation properties of networks are enabled by different frequency couplings in AD networks compared to HCs. Finally, we use the reconstructed networks for classification. The extra cross-frequency coupling information can improve the classification performance significantly, suggesting an important role of cross-frequency FC. The results highlight the importance of studying nonlinearity and including cross-frequency FC in characterising AD.",

The data provided by such technology can estimate the bioenergy source production rate and monitor deforestation. This work participates in the cause by contributing an aerial dataset and developing an intelligent tree-detection system usable for counting trees with the bioenergy potential. Low-altitude flying units have been vastly used for such a purpose due to their ability to capture high-quality data from distant locations. Despite these potentials, collected images that compose a dataset are often characterized by imbalanced distribution among classes. The class disproportion can affect the overall model performance, as it severely deprives key features of under-represented classes. This study proposes data-level approaches that adopt and extend prior sampling algorithms for object detection problems. The devised techniques try to reduce the number of redundant outputs obtained from sampling methods and reduce the iteration required to achieve the target imbalance ratio by employing a systematic flow. In such a process, the class distribution of an original dataset is used as a guideline for selecting candidates for subsequent processes. Our results show that the modified dataset can reduce the length of a training process shown by fewer iterations required to achieve the final metrics of its original dataset version and lower training losses in each iteration. Additionally, the modified dataset can improve the F-score (F1) and precision metric of object detection algorithm by up to 6%.",

While wrist-worn sensing devices have garnered significant interest, their value for daily practice is still unclear. In this narrative review, we survey demographic, clinical and technological information from 39 articles across four public databases. Wrist-worn technology mainly monitors motor symptoms and sleep disorders of patients in daily life. We find that accelerometers are the most commonly used sensors to measure the movement of people living with PD.

Accessible and non-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore urgently required. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to predict AD with high accuracy, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been properly studied in the case of AD and EEG. Energy landscape analysis is a method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations across brain regions. The energy is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. By studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and 20 age-matched healthy counterparts (HC), significant differences are found. The dynamics of AD patients' EEG are shown to be more constrained - with more local minima, less variation in basin size, and smaller basins. We show that energy landscapes can predict AD with high accuracy, performing significantly better than baseline models. Moreover, these findings are replicated in a separate dataset including 9 AD and 10 HC above 70 years old.",

These models are then assessed across several criteria, i.e. ease of identifying the type of gene regulation, the predictive capability, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the robustness to parameter uncertainty to determine its viability of balancing between biological complexity and accuracy when modelling the pathogen-infected plant GRN. Using our defined ranking score, we obtain the following insights to the modelling of GRN. Our analyses show that despite commonly used and provide biological relevance, the Hill Function model ranks the lowest while the extended S-System model ranks highest in the overall comparison.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia worldwide. AD disrupts neuronal pathways and thus is commonly viewed as a network disorder. Many studies demonstrate the power of functional connectivity (FC) graph-based biomarkers for automated diagnosis of AD using electroencephalography (EEG). However, various FC measures are commonly utilised, as each aims to quantify a unique aspect of brain coupling. Graph neural networks (GNN) provide a powerful framework for learning on graphs. While a growing number of studies use GNN to classify EEG brain graphs, it is unclear which method should be utilised to estimate the brain graph. We use eight FC measures to estimate FC brain graphs from sensor-level EEG signals. GNN models are trained in order to compare the performance of the selected FC measures. Additionally, three baseline models based on literature are trained for comparison. We show that GNN models perform significantly better than the other baseline models. Moreover, using FC measures to estimate brain graphs improves the performance of GNN compared to models trained using a fixed graph based on the spatial distance between the EEG sensors. However, no FC measure performs consistently better than the other measures. The best GNN reaches 0.984 area under sensitivity-specificity curve (AUC) and 92% accuracy, whereas the best baseline model, a convolutional neural network, has 0.924 AUC and 84.7% accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Background: Many physical, biological and neural systems behave as coupled oscillators, with characteristic phase coupling across different frequencies. Methods such as n:m phase locking value (where two coupling frequencies are linked as: mf1=nf2) and bi-phase locking value have previously been proposed to quantify phase coupling between two resonant frequencies (e.g. f,2f/3) and across three frequencies (e.g. f1,f2,f1+f2), respectively. However, the existing phase coupling metrics have their limitations and limited applications. They cannot be used to detect or quantify phase coupling across multiple frequencies (e.g. f1,f2,f3,f4,f1+f2+f3-f4), or coupling that involves non-integer multiples of the frequencies (e.g. f1,f2,2f1/3+f2/3). New methods: To address the gap, this paper proposes a generalized approach, named multi-phase locking value (M-PLV), for the quantification of various types of instantaneous multi-frequency phase coupling. Different from most instantaneous phase coupling metrics that measure the simultaneous phase coupling, the proposed M-PLV method also allows the detection of delayed phase coupling and the associated time lag between coupled oscillators. Results: The M-PLV has been tested on cases where synthetic coupled signals are generated using white Gaussian signals, and a system comprised of multiple coupled Rössler oscillators, as well as a human subject dataset. Results indicate that the M-PLV can provide a reliable estimation of the time window and frequency combination where the phase coupling is significant, as well as a precise determination of time lag in the case of delayed coupling. This method has the potential to become a powerful new tool for exploring phase coupling in complex nonlinear dynamic systems.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder known to affect functional connectivity (FC) across many brain regions. Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation from each other. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis approach, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. This work reports the first use of cross-bispectrum to reconstruct a cross-frequency FC network where each frequency band is treated as a layer in a multilayer network with both inter- and intra-layer edges. An increase of within-band FC in AD is observed in low-frequency bands using both methods. Bispectrum also detects multiple cross-frequency differences, mainly increased FC in AD in delta-theta coupling. An increased importance of low-frequency coupling and decreased importance of high-frequency coupling is observed in AD. Integration properties of AD networks are more vulnerable than HC, while the segregation property is maintained in AD. Moreover, the segregation property of γ is less vulnerable in AD, suggesting the shift of importance from high-frequency activity towards low-frequency components. The results highlight the importance of studying nonlinearity and including cross-frequency FC in characterising AD. Moreover, the results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of using bispectrum to reconstruct FC networks.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, with around 50 million patients worldwide. Accessible and non-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore urgently required. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to predict AD with high accuracy, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been properly studied in the case of AD and EEG data. Energy landscape analysis is a method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations across brain regions. The energy is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. By studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and 20 healthy age-matched counterparts, significant differences were found. The dynamics of AD patients' brain networks were shown to be more constrained - with more local minima, less variation in basin size, and smaller basins. We show that energy landscapes can predict AD with high accuracy, performing significantly better than baseline models.",

      "abstract": "The importance of an optimal solution for disaster evacuation has recently raised attention from researchers across multiple disciplines. This is not only a serious, but also a challenging task due to the complexities of the evacuees’ behaviors, route planning, and demanding coordination services. Although existing studies have addressed these challenges to some extent, mass evacuation in natural disasters tends to be difficult to predict and manage due to the limitation of the underlying models to capture realistic situations. It is therefore desirable to have on-demand mechanisms of locally-driven computing and data exchange services in order to enable near real-time capture of the disaster area during the evacuation. For this purpose, this paper comprehensively surveys recent advances in information and communication technology-enabled disaster evacuations, with the focus on fog computation and communication services to support a massive evacuation process. A numerous variety of tools and techniques are encapsulated within a coordinated on-demand strategy of an evacuation platform, which is aimed to provide a situational awareness and response. Herein fog services appear to be one of the viable options for responsive mass evacuation because they enable low latency data processing and dissemination. They can additionally provide data analytics support for autonomous learning for both the short-term guidance supports and long-term usages. This work extends the existing data-oriented framework by outlining comprehensive functionalities and providing seamless integration. We review the principles, challenges, and future direction of the state-of-the-art strategies proposed to sit within each functionality. Taken together, this survey highlights the importance of adaptive coordination and reconfiguration within the fog services to facilitate responsive mass evacuations as well as open up new research challenges associated with analytics-embedding network and computati",

For decades, linear connectivity analysis methods, such as correlation, coherence and Granger causality, have been extensively used to assess the neural connectivities and input–output interconnections in neural systems. Recent studies indicate that these linear methods can only capture a certain amount of neural activities and functional relationships, and therefore cannot describe neural behaviours in a precise or complete way. In this review, we highlight recent advances in nonlinear system identification of neural systems, corresponding time and frequency domain analysis, and novel neural connectivity measures based on nonlinear system identification techniques. We argue that nonlinear modelling and analysis are necessary to study neuronal processing and signal transfer in neural systems quantitatively. These approaches can hopefully provide new insights to advance our understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying neural functions. These nonlinear approaches also have the potential to produce sensitive biomarkers to facilitate the development of precision diagnostic tools for evaluating neurological disorders and the effects of targeted intervention.",

While existing studies have mainly utilized joint computation with direct coordination between nodes in different segments, it is worth considering another scenario where an additional node within a layer relays data to another layer. As a consequence, the node can serve as an aggregation point for data capture units prior to transmission to the sink node. However, this new arrangement produces additional transmission paths and can thus cause additional energy spending. This pilot study investigates the joint computation problem aiming at optimizing energy consumption. Relevant components, such as computation and communication, are taken into account and modeled into formal representation. A genetic algorithm-based solution is then used as a tool to optimize parameter setup. According to the experiment results, the metaheuristic algorithm has potential to achieve the optimal system configuration, emphasizing the data length that affects the final energy spending on communications. However, the algorithm cannot always guarantee the optimality as it relies on the random variable used in the process.",

      "abstract": "Background: The incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing with the ageing population. The development of low cost non-invasive diagnostic aids for AD is a research priority. This pilot study investigated whether an approach based on a novel dynamic quantitative parametric EEG method could detect abnormalities in people with AD. Methods: 20 patients with probable AD, 20 matched healthy controls (HC) and 4 patients with probable fronto temporal dementia (FTD) were included. All had detailed neuropsychology along with structural, resting state fMRI and EEG. EEG data were analyzed using the Error Reduction Ratio-causality (ERR-causality) test that can capture both linear and nonlinear interactions between different EEG recording areas. The 95% confidence intervals of EEG levels of bi-centroparietal synchronization were estimated for eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) states. Results: In the EC state, AD patients and HC had very similar levels of bi-centro parietal synchronization; but in the EO resting state, patients with AD had significantly higher levels of synchronization (AD = 0.44; interquartile range (IQR) 0.41 vs. HC = 0.15; IQR 0.17, p < 0.0001). The EO/EC synchronization ratio, a measure of the dynamic changes between the two states, also showed significant differences between these two groups (AD ratio 0.78 versus HC ratio 0.37 p < 0.0001). EO synchronization was also significantly different between AD and FTD (FTD = 0.075; IQR 0.03, p < 0.0001). However, the EO/EC ratio was not informative in the FTD group due to very low levels of synchronization in both states (EO and EC). Conclusion: In this pilot work, resting state quantitative EEG shows significant differences between healthy controls and patients with AD. This approach has the potential to develop into a useful non-invasive and economical diagnostic aid in AD.",

Methods: We applied nonlinear methods, the error reduction ratio (ERR) causality test and cross-frequency analysis, with a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model, to electroencephalograms (EEGs) from CAE, selected with stringent electro-clinical criteria (17 cases, 42 absences). We analysed the pre-ictal and ictal strength of association between homologous and heterologous EEG derivations and estimated the direction of synchronisation and corresponding time lags. Results: A frontal/fronto-central onset of the absences is detected in 13 of the 17 cases with the highest ictal strength of association between homologous frontal followed by centro-temporal and fronto-central areas. Delays consistently in excess of 4 ms occur at the very onset between these regions, swiftly followed by the emergence of “isochronous” (0–2 ms) synchronisation but dynamic time lag changes occur during SW discharges. Conclusions: In absences an initial cortico-cortical spread leads to dynamic lag changes to include periods of isochronous interhemispheric synchronisation, which we hypothesize is mediated by the thalamus. Significance: Absences from CAE show ictal epileptic network dynamics remarkably similar to those observed in WAG/Rij rats which guided the formulation of the cortical focus theory.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing evidence to suggest that essential tremor has a central origin. Different structures appear to be part of the central tremorogenic network, including the motor cortex, the thalamus and the cerebellum. Some studies using electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) show linear association in the tremor frequency between the motor cortex and the contralateral tremor electromyography (EMG). Additionally, high thalamomuscular coherence is found with the use of thalamic local field potential (LFP) recordings and tremulous EMG in patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Despite a well-established reciprocal anatomical connection between the thalamus and cortex, the functional association between the two structures during \"tremor-on\" periods remains elusive. Thalamic (Vim) LFPs, ipsilateral scalp EEG from the sensorimotor cortex and contralateral tremor arm EMG recordings were obtained from two patients with essential tremor who had undergone successful surgery for DBS. Coherence analysis shows a strong linear association between thalamic LFPs and contralateral tremor EMG, but the relationship between the EEG and the thalamus is much less clear. These measurements were then analyzed by constructing a novel parametric nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) model. This new approach uncovered two distinct and not overlapping frequency \"channels\" of communication between Vim thalamus and the ipsilateral motor cortex, defining robustly \"tremor-on\" versus \"tremor-off\" states. The associated estimated nonlinear time lags also showed non-overlapping values between the two states, with longer corticothalamic lags (exceeding 50 ms) in the tremor active state, suggesting involvement of an indirect multisynaptic loop. The results reveal the importance of the nonlinear interactions between cortical and subcortical areas in the central motor network of essential tremor.

With the advent of computational systems biology, this endeavour is usually carried out through in silico theoretical studies with the aim to guide and complement further in vitro and in vivo experimental efforts. Clearly, what counts is the result in vivo, not only in terms of maximal productivity but also robustness against environmental perturbations. Engineering an organism towards an increased production flux, however, often compromises that robustness. In this contribution, we review and investigate how various analytical approaches used in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology are related to concepts developed by systems and control engineering. While trade-offs between production optimality and cellular robustness have already been studied diagnostically and statically, the dynamics also matter. Integration of the dynamic design aspects of control engineering with the more diagnostic aspects of metabolic, hierarchical control and regulation analysis is leading to the new, conceptual and operational framework required for the design of robust and productive dynamic pathways.",

By modeling the nonlinear relationships between time series using nonlinear models and employing corresponding frequency-domain analysis techniques (i.e. generalized frequency response functions), a new nonlinear partial directed coherence method is derived. Results: The advantages of the new method are illustrated via a numerical example of a nonlinear physical system and an application to electroencephalogram signals from a patient with childhood absence epilepsy. Comparison with existing methods: The new method detects both linear and nonlinear casual effects between bivariate signals in the frequency domain, while the existing measures can only detect linear effects.

In this study, it is shown that the classical Geweke's spectral causality measure can be explicitly linked with the output spectra of corresponding restricted and unrestricted time-domain models. The latter representation is then generalized to nonlinear bivariate signals and for the first time nonlinear causality analysis in the frequency domain.

Biological networks constitute a type of information and communication technology (ICT): they receive information from the outside and inside of cells, integrate and interpret this information, and then activate a response. Biological networks enable molecules within cells, and even cells themselves, to communicate with each other and their environment. We have become accustomed to associating brain activity - particularly activity of the human brain - with a phenomenon we call \"intelligence.\" Yet, four billion years of evolution could have selected networks with topologies and dynamics that confer traits analogous to this intelligence, even though they were outside the intercellular networks of the brain. Here, we explore how macromolecular networks in microbes confer intelligent characteristics, such as memory, anticipation, adaptation and reflection and we review current understanding of how network organization reflects the type of intelligence required for the environments in which they were selected. We propose that, if we were to leave terms such as \"human\" and \"brain\" out of the defining features of \"intelligence,\" all forms of life - from microbes to humans - exhibit some or all characteristics consistent with \"intelligence.\" We then review advances in genome-wide data production and analysis, especially in microbes, that provide a lens into microbial intelligence and propose how the insights derived from quantitatively characterizing biomolecular networks may enable synthetic biologists to create intelligent molecular networks for biotechnology, possibly generating new forms of intelligence, first in silico and then in vivo.",

Supply-demand theory has not yet considered gene-expression regulation explicitly whilst a variant of MCA, i.e. Hierarchical Control Analysis (HCA), has done so. Existing analyses based on control engineering approaches have not been very explicit about whether metabolic or gene-expression regulation would be involved, but designed different ways in which regulation could be organized, with the potential of causing adaptation to be perfect.Results: This study integrates control engineering and classical MCA augmented with supply-demand theory and HCA. Because gene-expression regulation involves time integration, it is identified as a natural instantiation of the 'integral control' (or near integral control) known in control engineering. This study then focuses on robustness against and adaptation to perturbations of process activities in the network, which could result from environmental perturbations, mutations or slow noise. It is shown however that this type of 'integral control' should rarely be expected to lead to the 'perfect adaptation': although the gene-expression regulation increases the robustness of important metabolite concentrations, it rarely makes them infinitely robust. For perfect adaptation to occur, the protein degradation reactions should be zero order in the concentration of the protein, which may be rare biologically for cells growing steadily.Conclusions: A proposed new framework integrating the methodologies of control engineering and metabolic and hierarchical control analysis, improves the understanding of biological systems that are regulated both metabolically and by gene expression.

The quality of conventional optimal experimental design largely depends on the accuracy of model parameter estimation, which is often either unavailable or poorly estimated at the stage of design. Robust experimental design (RED) algorithms have thus been proposed when model parametric uncertainties need to be addressed during the design process. In this paper, two robust design strategies are investigated and the comparative study has been made on signal pathway models. The first method is a maximin experimental design approach which is a worst-case design strategy, and the second method is the Bayesian experimental design that 'takes an average' of the parametric uncertainty effects. The limitations of the maximin design which describes the structural uncertainty using a local Taylor representation are quantitatively evaluated. To better quantitatively assess the differences between the maximin and the Bayesian REDs, a concept of effective design parameters is proposed, from which the advantages of the Bayesian design is demonstrated especially in the case of large model uncertainties.",

In this paper, the recently published 'Proximate Parameter Tuning' (PPT) method for the identification of biochemical networks is analysed. In particular, it is shown that the described PPT algorithm is essentially equivalent to a sequential linear programming implementation of a constrained optimization problem. The corresponding objective function consists of two parts, the first emphasises the data fitting where a residual 1-norm is used, and the second emphasises the proximity of the calculated parameters to the specified nominal values, using an ∞-norm. The optimality properties of PPT algorithm solution as well as its geometric interpretation are analyzed. The concept of optimal parameter locus is applied for the exploration of the entire family of optimal solutions. An efficient implementation of the parameter locus is also developed. Parallels are drawn with 1-norm parameter deviation regularization which attempt to fit the data with a minimal number of parameters. Finally, a small example is used to illustrate all of these properties.",

In particular, this paper analyzes the limitations associated with collocation-based approaches to pathway parameter locus identification which transform dynamic parameter estimation into a simple algebraic problem. The bias associated with these approaches can be overcome using a dynamic basis pursuit regularization approach which is developed, analyzed and compared with collocation approaches.",

The first is a mini-max robust experimental design approach, the second is a sampled experimental design method inspired by the Morris global sensitivity analysis.

      "abstract": "Wireless sensor nodes, used in disaster management and industrial applications, typically require high reliability and low energy consumption. This reliability is often hindered due to bursty channel errors in practical wireless systems. The existing retransmission scheme used in IEEE 802.15.4 fails to capture the characteristics of burst channels as they are designed under the assumption of uniform error channels. Thus, they do not significantly improve the reliability under bursty channels while increasing the energy consumption with multiple retransmissions. Our proposed method utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop an adaptive retransmission strategy. This strategy is informed by analysing the transmission history of the sensor. The RL algorithm learns the optimal policy, which maximises energy efficiency and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) in networks with burst channel errors. Our RL retransmission strategy performed better in PDR and energy efficiency than the IEEE 802.15.4 andRetransmission Adaptive Intelligence Medium Access Control (RAI-MAC) proposed in the literature. By adaptively modifying the retransmission strategy, we improved the energy efficiency and PDR by 16% and 10%, respectively, under a 10-15% packet error rate. The results highlight the importance of an adaptive retransmission strategy for resource-constrained wireless sensors.",

Remote human activity recognition (HAR) is beneficial for regular monitoring of the elderly population. This paper addresses the problem of the continuous detection of daily human activities using a mm-wave Doppler radar. In this study, two strategies have been employed: the first method uses un-equalized series of activities, whereas the second method utilizes a gradient-based strategy for equalization of the series of activities. The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) techniques have been implemented for the classification of un-equalized and equalized series of activities, respectively. The input for DTW was provided using three strategies. The first approach uses the pixel-level data of frames (UnSup-PLevel).

The extracted features were considered as an input to the LSTM. This paper presents a comparative analysis of a novel supervised feature extraction pipeline, employing Sup-ENLevel-DTW and Sup-EnLevel-LSTM, against several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, including UnSUp-EnLevel-DTW, UnSup-EnLevel-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and PCA-LSTM.

To alleviate the labour-intensive task of pixel-wise image labelling, we present a novel application of a modified conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to generate artificial satellite images and corresponding farm labels. Additionally, we scrutinize the role of spectral bands in satellite image segmentation and compare two prominent semantic segmentation models, U-Net and DeepLabV3+, with diverse backbone structures. Our empirical findings demonstrate that augmenting the dataset with up to 22.85% artificial samples significantly enhances the model performance. Notably, the U-Net model, employing standard convolution, outperforms the DeepLabV3+ models with atrous convolution, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 86.92% on the test data.",

      "year": "2025",
      "abstract": "The emotion–cause pair extraction (ECPE) task is to simultaneously extract emotions and causes as pairs (EC-pairs) from documents, which is important for natural language processing. Previous research tackled this task via a two-step approach, which first predicts separately the emotion and cause clauses, and then pairs them up by using a binary classifier. However, such a two-step approach may suffer from the possible propagation of errors, and it neglects the interaction between emotions and causes. In this article, an end-to-end double-graph method with relational enhancement (DGRE) is proposed to stimulate two relationship modes among clauses, i.e., semantic dependence and logical dependence. First, two united graph encoders are established to embed the semantic dependence into the representation of clauses and pairs. The first encoder is built on graph attention networks (GATs) for clause-level representation, the result of which is used by a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) for the refinement of pair-level representation. Aiming to enhance the fitting ability of logical dependence, the emotion-type classification task is introduced into the multitask learning framework of GATs, which can effectively distinguish the logical relations between clauses according to their emotion types. Moreover, seven types of dependence relations have been designed for the node connections in RGCN, which emphasize the contextual interaction and clustering among neighboring nodes. Experiments on a benchmark Chinese corpus demonstrate that the proposed DGRE approach could effectively establish the communication mechanism between clauses and pairs from multiple perspectives, and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models well validate its effectiveness.",

Despite these advancements, the black-box nature of AI models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as industry stakeholders require systems that are both transparent and trustworthy. This study presents a systematic literature review examining how human-in-the-loop explainable AI (HITL-XAI) approaches can enhance the effectiveness and adoption of AI systems in PdM contexts. This review followed the PRISMA methodology, employing predefined search strings across Scopus, ProQuest, and EBSCO databases. Sixty-three peer-reviewed journal articles, published between 2019 and early 2025, were included in the final analysis. The selected studies span various domains, including industrial manufacturing, energy, and transportation, with findings synthesized through both descriptive and thematic analyses. A key gap identified is the limited empirical exploration of generative AI (GenAI) in improving the usability, interpretability, and trustworthiness of HITL-XAI systems in PdM applications. This review outlines actionable insights for integrating explainability and GenAI into existing rule-based PdM systems to support more adaptive and reliable maintenance strategies. Ultimately, the findings underscore the importance of designing HITL-XAI systems that not only demonstrate high model performance but are also effectively aligned with operational workflows and the cognitive needs of maintenance personnel.",

Traditional numerical models struggle in such settings due to high computational cost, the need for extensive mesh generation, and difficulties in assimilating heterogeneous data sources. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework that integrates governing physical laws, satellite-derived vegetation data, and outputs from high- resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the Sundarbans mangrove system. The proposed hybrid PINN model incorporates shallow water flow and sediment transport equations into the loss function and uses a temporal causality weighting mechanism to improve convergence in time-dependent domains. Model outputs include elevation, flow velocity, and suspended sediment concentration. The model is trained using a small subset of CFD simulation data and validated against a traditional finite element (FE) solver and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) baseline. The proposed hybrid PINNs model achieved RMSE values in the range of 10−2for elevation and velocity and 10−3for sediment concentration, significantly outperforming the CNN model, particularly in generalising to unseen time steps. Compared to the FE model, the proposed framework achieved a five-fold reduction in training time (24 h vs. 5 days) and supports inference within seconds, enabling near real-time predictions. The mesh-free structure of the model, combined with its physics-regularised learning, also facilitates adaptation to other coastal or mangrove systems governed by similar dynamics. This hybrid approach offers a robust, generalisable surrogate for high-fidelity coastal simulations in data-scarce and computationally demanding environments.",

The challenges include: 1) conventional methods presuppose that a \"one-model-fits-all\"approach works for activity evaluation, ignoring that subject-specific differences can lead to suboptimal results if these differences are not considered. 2) Previous studies focus on offline learning, where models are trained on the entire dataset, which can be updated later through retraining. This approach neglects the need for continual learning, where models adapt sequentially to new subjects while retaining past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel continual meta-learning approach and a memory buffer to provide personalized deep squat evaluations. Using Azure Kinect sensors, we collected RGB-D videos and 3D skeletal data from 33 participants performing deep squats, annotated with Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scores. Our model dynamically adapts to new participants while retaining knowledge from previous ones, preventing performance degradation over time. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms a model without a buffer memory technique by retaining learned knowledge across participants and adapting to new individuals with minimal data.",

To achieve this, several tools, leveraging constraint-based stoichiometric models and metaheuristic algorithms like particle swarm optimization (PSO), have been developed. However, PSO can potentially get trapped in local optima. Quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO) overcomes this limitation, and our study further enhances its binary version (BQPSO) with a neighborhood topology, leading to the advanced neighborhood-based BQPSO (NBQPSO). Combined with flux balance analysis (FBA), this forms an innovative approach, NBQPSO-FBA, for identifying optimal knockout strategies to maximize the desired metabolite production. Additionally, we introduced a novel encoding strategy suitable for large-scale genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs). Evaluated on four E. coli GSMMs (iJR904, iAF1260, iJO1366, and iML1515), NBQPSO-FBA matches or surpasses established bi-level linear programming (LP) and heuristic methods in metabolite production optimization. Notably, it achieved 90.69% realization of the theoretical maximum in acetate production and demonstrated comparable performance with leading algorithms in lactate production. The efficiency of NBQPSO-FBA, which requires fewer knockouts, makes it a practical and effective tool for optimizing microbial cell factories. This addresses the rising demand for microbial products across various industries.",

Existing research addresses the ECPE task through a two-step or an end-to-end approach. Although previous work shows promising performances, they suffer from two limitations: 1) they fail to take full advantage of emotion type information, which has advantages for modelling the dependencies between emotion and cause clauses from a semantic perspective; 2) they ignored the interaction between local and global information, which is important for ECPE. To address these issues, we propose an ECPE Pair Generator (ECPE-PG), with a Clause-Encoder layer, a Pre-Output layer and an Information Interaction-based Pair Generation (IIPG) Module embedded. This model first encodes clauses into vector representations through the Clause-Encoder layer and then preforms emotion clause extraction (EE), cause clause extraction (CE) and emotion type extraction (ETE), respectively, through the Pre-Output layer, on the basis of which the IIPG module analyzes the complex emotional logic of relationships between clauses and estimates the candidate pairs based on the interaction of global and local information. It should be noted that emotion type information is regarded as a crucial indication in the IIPG module to assist the identification of emotion-cause pairs. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Early detection of diabetic retinopathy, a complication of vision loss in advanced stages of diabetes, is essential to avoid permanent blindness. However, the automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy through medical image processing requires a large number of training data to build a model with good performance. This poses a challenge when working with small datasets as these models need large datasets to perform well on unseen data. In this paper, we design a few-shot Siamese Neural Networks combined with pre-trained models, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, to effectively differentiate between classes using small lesions in the retinal images. The proposed model is trained based on the similarity between the pair of images using a comparatively small dataset and performs well for a five-class classification problem. We use the Fine-Grained Annotated Diabetic Retinopathy (FGADR) and APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset, where a small ratio of training images is used to train the model. To evaluate our model, we conduct the testing on the remaining data and achieve good accuracy when trained on limited images, with fewer epochs and fewer parameters. The proposed model achieves high accuracy rates on five-class classification of 80% on FGADR and 81% on APTOS 2019 datasets, with a consistent quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) score of 0.89 across both datasets. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of hyperparameter optimisation, specifically investigating different pair selection techniques, loss functions, and distance layers to thoroughly evaluate their impact on the performance of the model. Our proposed model demonstrates promising results when combined with an attention mechanism to perform multiclass classification of diabetic retinopathy using a limited number of eye fundus images, outperforming existing approaches with only a small number of epochs in training.",

      "abstract": "For over a century, induction furnaces have been used in the core of foundries for metal melting and heating. They provide high melting/heating rates with optimal efficiency. The occurrence of faults not only imposes safety risks but also reduces productivity due to unscheduled shutdowns. The problem of diagnosing faults in induction furnaces has not yet been studied, and this work is the first to propose a data-driven framework for diagnosing faults in this application. This paper presents a deep neural network framework for diagnosing electrical faults by measuring real-time electrical parameters at the supply side. Experimental and sensory measurements are collected from multiple energy analyzer devices installed in the foundry. Next, a semi-supervised learning approach, known as the local outlier factor, has been used to discriminate normal and faulty samples from each other and label the data samples. Then, a deep neural network is trained with the collected labeled samples. The performance of the developed model is compared with several state-of-the-art techniques in terms of various performance metrics. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the selected deep neural network model over other classifiers, with an average F-measure of 0.9187. Due to the black box nature of the constructed neural network, the model predictions are interpreted by Shapley additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. The interpretability analysis reveals that classified faults are closely linked to variations in odd voltage/current harmonics of order 3, 11, 13, and 17, highlighting the critical impact of these parameters on the model’s prediction.",

      "abstract": "Sentiment analysis aims to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspects within given sentences or comments, and aspect-based sentiment analysis is considered a fundamental task in sentiment analysis. With practical applications in areas such as product reviews, food delivery evaluations, and public opinion monitoring, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role. This paper focuses on the application of fine-grained sentiment analysis in financial distress prediction (FDP) to enhance early warnings of the management status of companies. In previous studies, there has been a narrow emphasis on using document-level sentiment analysis to extract overall sentiment from text, overlooking the semantic nuances conveyed by sentiments. Therefore, this paper aims to extract fine-grained sentiments from the Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) of Chinese listed companies. The proposed model is based on a two-step framework, consisting of an unsupervised aspect-level financial sentiment extraction phase and a model validation phase. Specifically, the former is built on a deep learning model with an attention mechanism, conducting unsupervised aspect extraction, aspect identification, and aspect-level sentiment classification in a sequential manner to obtain fine-grained sentiments. The latter is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the newly acquired features on benchmark machine learning models, including SVM, DT, LR, CNN, and DNN. Experimental results reveal that MD&A predominantly covers eight types of aspects, including ownership, business scope, development, capital, sales, management, prizes, and probability. Additionally, it has been observed that fine-grained sentiment features can enhance the performance of FDP. This study represents a significant innovation in existing literature, being the first to introduce aspect-level financial sentiment analysis into the realm of FDP.",

      "abstract": "Blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles provides a reliable collaboration environment for traffic entities and promotes road safety and traffic efficiency through real-time sharings between vehicles and infrastructure. However, a bottleneck is likely to emerge as the Internet of Vehicles scales up. In this paper, we propose a novel Graphical Consensus-based Sharding (GCS) framework, which is underpinned by four important strategies: 1) A graphical consensus is adopted as its intra-shard consensus, where the consensus group is set up according to its maximal connected subgraph, and the leader is elected by its reliability weight. The consensus group is refreshed intermittently by alternating the leader role. 2) Within GCS, the intra-shard data are stored in the local chain, while a block-based directed acyclic graph, rather than a chained structure, is employed as the main chain. The local chain is used to respond to requests within each shard, and the main chain supports the cross-shard sharings. GCS will parallelly optimize the throughput of the blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles. 3) GCS further introduces the shard backup and the node scheduling to handle shard failure and overheating by using new backup strategies and a temporal-spatial graph convolutional network prediction model, respectively. 4) An off-chain transmission algorithm is presented for secure sharing between the infrastructure and the vehicles. Simulation results show that the number of Transactions Per Second is 1.69 times higher than that of the non-sharding blockchain, and the pending time is dramatically reduced compared to the mainstreaming sharding approach, which is 1.02s.",

In this article, we fully make use of the consensus and complementary information, and exploit a bipartite graph to depict the duality relationship between original points and anchor points. To be specific, representative anchor points are selected for each view to construct corresponding anchor representation matrices, and all views' anchor points are utilized to construct a common representation matrix. Using anchor points also reduces the computation complexity. Next, the bipartite graph is built by fusing these representation matrices, and a Laplacian rank constraint is enforced on the bipartite graph. This will make the bipartite graph have k connected components to obtain accurate clustering labels, where the bipartite graph is specifically designed for a large-scale dataset problem. In addition, the anchor points are also updated by dictionary learning. The experimental results on the four benchmark image processing datasets have demonstrated superior performance of the proposed large-scale multi-view clustering algorithm over other state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms.

      "abstract": "Research evidence shows that physical rehabilitation exercises prescribed by medical experts can assist in restoring physical function, improving life quality, and promoting independence for physically disabled individuals. In response to the absence of immediate expert feedback on performed actions, developing a Human Action Evaluation (HAE) system emerges as a valuable automated solution, addressing the need for accurate assessment of exercises and guidance during physical rehabilitation. Previous HAE systems developed for the rehabilitation exercises have focused on developing models that utilize skeleton data as input to compute a quality score for each action performed by the patient. However, existing studies have focused on improving scoring performance while often overlooking computational efficiency. In this research, we propose LightPRA (Light Physical Rehabilitation Assessment) system, an innovative architectural solution based on a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), which harnesses the capabilities of dilated causal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This approach efficiently captures complex temporal features and characteristics of the skeleton data with lower computational complexity, making it suitable for real-time feedback provided on resource-constrained devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Edge computing frameworks. Through empirical analysis performed on the University of Idaho-Physical Rehabilitation Movement Data (UI-PRMD) and KInematic assessment of MOvement for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation (KIMORE) datasets, our proposed LightPRA model demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art approaches such as Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based models in scoring human activity performance, while exhibiting lower computational cost and complexity.",

      "abstract": "The upsurge of autonomous vehicles in the automobile industry will lead to better driving experiences while also enabling the users to solve challenging navigation problems. Reaching such capabilities will require significant technological attention and the flawless execution of various complex tasks, one of which is ensuring robust localization and mapping. Recent surveys have not provided a meaningful and comprehensive description of the current approaches in this field. Accordingly, this review is intended to provide adequate coverage of the problems affecting autonomous vehicles in this area, by examining the most recent methods for mapping and localization as well as related feature extraction and data security problems. First, a discussion of the contemporary methods of extracting relevant features from equipped sensors and their categorization as semantic, non-semantic, and deep learning methods is presented. We conclude that representativeness, low cost, and accessibility are crucial constraints in the choice of the methods to be adopted for localization and mapping tasks. Second, the survey focuses on methods to build a vehicle’s environment map, considering both the commercial and the academic solutions available. The analysis proposes a difference between two types of environment, known and unknown, and develops solutions in each case. Third, the survey explores different approaches to vehicle localization and also classifies them according to their mathematical characteristics and priorities. Each section concludes by presenting the related challenges and some future directions. The article also highlights the security problems likely to be encountered in self-driving vehicles, with an assessment of possible defense mechanisms that could prevent security attacks in vehicles.

The encoder based on Res2Net is utilized for extracting multi-scale features from the input image. Simultaneously, with a single image as input, we introduce a pioneering training strategy tailored for a Res2Net-based encoder.

      "year": "2024",
      "abstract": "Premature convergence is a thorny problem for particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, especially on multimodal problems, where maintaining swarm diversity is crucial. However, most enhancement strategies for PSO, including the existing diversity-guided strategies, have not fully addressed this issue. This paper proposes the virtual position guided (VPG) strategy for PSO algorithms. The VPG strategy calculates diversity values for two different populations and establishes a diversity baseline. It then dynamically guides the algorithm to conduct different search behaviors, through three phases - divergence, normal, and acceleration - in each iteration, based on the relationships among these diversity values and the baseline. Collectively, these phases orchestrate different schemes to balance exploration and exploitation, collaboratively steering the algorithm away from local optima and towards enhanced solution quality. The introduction of ‘virtual position’ caters to the strategy's adaptability across various PSO algorithms, ensuring the generality and effectiveness of the proposed VPG strategy. With a single hyperparameter and a recommended usual setup, VPG is easy to implement. The experimental results demonstrate that the VPG strategy is superior to several canonical and the state-of-the-art strategies for diversity guidance, and is effective in improving the search performance of most PSO algorithms on multimodal problems of various dimensionalities.",

In the HQPSO, the Solis and Wets local search method is used to enhance the local search ability of the QPSO so that the algorithm can find solutions that is close to optimal when the constraints are met, and two evolution operators are proposed and incorporated for the purpose of making a better balance between local search and global search abilities at the later search stage. The performance comparison is made among the HQPSO and the other ten population-based random search methods under two different experimental configurations and four different power systems in terms of solution quality, robustness, and convergence property. The experimental results show that the HQPSO improves the convergence properties of the QPSO and finally obtains the best total generation cost without violating any constraints. In addition, the HQPSO outperforms all the other algorithms on 7 cases of all 8 experimental cases in terms of global best position and mean position, which verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

This paper proposes an effective word-level adversarial attack method based on sememes and an improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm. The sememe-based substitute method, which uses the words sharing the same sememes as the substitutes of the original words, is first employed to form the reduced search space. Then, an improved QPSO algorithm, so-called historical information guided QPSO with random drift local attractor (HIQPSO-RD), is proposed to search the reduced search space for adversarial examples. The HIQPSO-RD introduces historical information into the current mean best position of the QPSO, for the purpose of improving the convergence speed of the algorithm, by enhancing its exploration ability and preventing the premature convergence of the swarm. The proposed algorithm employs the random drift local attractor technique to make a good balance between its exploration and exploitation, so that the algorithm can find a better adversarial attack example with low grammaticality and perplexity. In addition, it employs a two-stage diversity control strategy to enhance the search performance of the algorithm. Experiments on three natural language processing (NLP) datasets, with three commonly used nature language processing models as victim models, show that our method achieves higher attack success rates and with lower modification rates than the state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods. Moreover, the results of human evaluations show that adversarial examples generated by our method can better maintain the semantic similarity and grammatical correctness of the original input.",

In this paper, a novel hybrid algorithm is proposed and applied in the docking environment of AutoDock version 4.2.6 in order to enhance the accuracy and the efficiency for dockings with flexible ligands. This search algorithm, called entropy-based Lamarckian quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (ELQPSO), is a combination of the QPSO with an entropy-based update strategy and the Solis and Wet local search (SWLS) method. By using the PDBbind core set v.2016, the ELQPSO is compared with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA), Lamarckian particle swarm optimization (LPSO) and Lamarckian QPSO (LQPSO). The experimental results reveal that the corresponding docking program of ELQPSO, named as EQDOCK in this paper, has a competitive performance in dealing with the protein-ligand docking problems. Moreover, for the test cases with different number of torsions, the EQDOCK outperforms the other three docking programs in finding docking conformations with small root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values in most cases. In particular, it has an advantage of solving highly flexible ligand docking problems over the others.",

      "abstract": "Soft computing models based on fuzzy or probabilistic approaches provide decision system makers with the necessary capabilities to deal with imprecise and incomplete information. Hybrid systems based on different soft computing approaches with complementary qualities and principles have also become popular. On the one hand, fuzzy logic makes its decisions on the basis of the degree of membership but gives no information on the frequency of an event; on the other hand, the probability informs us of the frequency of the event but gives no information on the degree of membership to a set. In this work, we propose a new measure that implements both fuzzy and probabilistic notions (i.e., the degree of membership and the frequency) while exploiting the ability of the convolution operator to combine functions on continuous intervals. This measure evaluates both the degree of membership and the frequency of objects/events in the design of decision support systems. We show, using concrete examples, the drawbacks of fuzzy logic and probability-based approaches taken separately, and we then show how a fuzzy probabilistic convolution measure allows the correction of these drawbacks. Based on this measure, we introduce a new clustering method named Fuzzy-Probabilistic-Convolution-C-Means (FP-Conv-CM). Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Probabilistic K-Means (PKM), and FP-Conv-CM were tested on multiple datasets and compared on the basis of two performance measures based on the Silhouette metric and the Dunn’s Index. FP-Conv-CM was shown to improve on both metrics. In addition, FCM, PKM, and FP-Conv-CM were used for multiple image compression tasks and were compared based on three performance measures: Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural SImilarity Index (SSIM). The proposed FP-Conv-CM method shows improvements in all these three measures as well.",

A depth-averaged model was built using a novel finite element model for simulating coastal models, within Thetis. The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world located between India and Bangladesh, is taken as a case study. The Sundarbans is regularly subjected to tropical cyclones, the impacts of which endanger the lives of the region’s four million people. This is a first-time application of a coupled hydro-morphodyamic model using discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretisation for modelling mangrove environments in a real-world application. A wetting drying scheme was implemented in the models in order to avoid numerical instabilities. The effect of mangrove environments is demonstrated ,by imposing a periodic tidal boundary, conditions using TPXO tidal solver, using experiments with and without mangroves. The model is validated against the results of another study on the same region and tidal gauge data. Mangrove environments are able to decrease water elevations and velocities by more than 97%, and prevent almost any sediment erosion when compared with the experiment with no mangroves.",

      "abstract": "Hand measurement is vital for hand-centric applications such as glove design, immobilization design, protective gear design, to name a few. Vision-based methods have been previously proposed but are limited in their ability to only extract hand dimensions in a static and standardized posture (open-palm hand). However, dynamic hand measurements should be considered when designing these wearable products since the interaction between hands and products cannot be ignored. Unfortunately, none of the existing methods are designed for measuring dynamic hands. To address this problem, we propose a user-friendly and fast method dubbed Measure4DHand, which automatically extracts dynamic hand measurements from a sequence of depth images captured by a single depth camera. Firstly, the ten dimensions of the hand are defined. Secondly, a deep neural network is developed to predict landmark sequences for the ten dimensions from partial point cloud sequences. Finally, a method is designed to calculate dimension values from landmark sequences. A novel synthetic dataset consisting of 234K hands in various shapes and poses, along with their corresponding ground truth landmarks, is proposed for training the proposed methods. The experiment based on real-world data captured by a Kinect illustrates the evolution of the ten dimensions during hand movement, while the mean ranges of variation are also reported, providing valuable information for the hand wearable product design.",

Compartment-based mathematical control models for diabetes usually result in objective functions whose terms are conflicting, preventing the use of single-objective-based models for obtaining appropriate personalized strategies. Taking into account the conflicting aspects when controlling the diabetic population dynamics, this paper introduces a multi-objective approach consisting of four steps: (a) modeling the problem of controlling the diabetic population dynamics using a multi-objective mathematical model, (b) discretizing the model using the trapezoidal rule and the Euler–Cauchy method, (c) using swarm-intelligence-based optimizers to solve the model and (d) structuring the set of controls using soft clustering methods, known for their flexibility. In contrast to single-objective approaches, experimental results show that the multi-objective approach obtains appropriate personalized controls, where the control associated with the compartment of diabetics without complications is totally different from that associated with the compartment of diabetics with complications. Moreover, these controls enable a significant reduction in the number of diabetics with and without complications, and the multi-objective strategy saves up to 4% of the resources needed for the control of diabetes without complications and up to 18% of resources for the control of diabetes with complications.",

      "abstract": "When implementing SVMs, two major problems are encountered: (a) the number of local minima of dual-SVM increases exponentially with the number of samples and (b) the computer storage memory required for a regular quadratic programming solver increases exponentially as the problem size expands. The Kernel-Adatron family of algorithms, gaining attention recently, has allowed us to handle very large classification and regression problems. However, these methods treat different types of samples (i.e., noise, border, and core) in the same manner, which makes these algorithms search in unpromising areas and increases the number of iterations as well. This paper introduces a hybrid method to overcome such shortcomings, called the Optimal Recurrent Neural Network and Density-Based Support Vector Machine (Opt-RNN-DBSVM). This method consists of four steps: (a) the characterization of different samples, (b) the elimination of samples with a low probability of being a support vector, (c) the construction of an appropriate recurrent neural network to solve the dual-DBSVM based on an original energy function, and (d) finding the solution to the system of differential equations that govern the dynamics of the RNN, using the Euler–Cauchy method involving an optimal time step. Density-based preprocessing reduces the number of local minima in the dual-SVM. The RNN’s recurring architecture avoids the need to explore recently visited areas. With the optimal time step, the search moves from the current vectors to the best neighboring support vectors. It is demonstrated that RNN-SVM converges to feasible support vectors and Opt-RNN-DBSVM has very low time complexity compared to the RNN-SVM with a constant time step and the Kernel-Adatron algorithm–SVM. Several classification performance measures are used to compare Opt-RNN-DBSVM with different classification methods and the results obtained show the good performance of the proposed method.",

Nevertheless, simulation of such dynamics is faced with computational and time constraints, given the nonlinear and complex nature of the problem, which could become a bottleneck for large-scale applications. The recent advances in machine learning, specifically, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), have gained much attention due to the potential to provide fast and accurate results, while preserving the binding physics laws and requiring small amounts of data in contrast to other neural networks. In this sense, such networks encode the physics equations into the neural network, and the latter must fit the noisy observed data whilst minimising the equation residual. This study investigates the application of PINNs to quantify the capacity of mangrove environments to attenuate waves and prevent erosion, and represents the first application of PINNs to model vegetation for a large-scale geographical domain with complex boundary conditions. Navier–Stokes, the broadly used mathematical equation to solve for fluid dynamics, is used as the governing equation that constrains the neural network to respect the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world located between India and Bangladesh, is taken as a case study. The results demonstrate that the developed model is superior when compared to a numerical finite element model, in terms of time and data efficiency, yet produces equally strong overall results.",

Considering this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid QPSO with dynamic grouping searching strategy, named QPSO-DGS. During the search process, the particle swarm is dynamically grouped into two subpopulations, which are assigned to implement the exploration and exploitation search, respectively. In each subpopulation, a comprehensive learning strategy is used for each particle to adjust its personal best position with a certain probability. Besides, a modified opposition-based computation is employed to improve the swarm diversity. The experimental comparison is conducted between the QPSO-DGS and other seven state-of-art PSO variants on the CEC’2013 test suit. The experimental results show that QPSO-DGS has a promising performance in terms of the solution accuracy and the convergence speed on the majority of these test functions, and especially on multimodal problems.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a postprocessing-based spectral-spatial classification (SSC) approach for hyperspectral (HS) images. The approach effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional pixel-based classifiers by integrating spectral and spatial information to achieve improved classification results. Specifically, the proposed method uses principal component analysis to transform the HS images and the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier to quickly derive spectral-posterior probabilities. Spatial-posterior probabilities are then computed using an adaptive fast Fourier transform (AFFT) and a probabilistic closeness function. These probabilities are then combined to generate a precise SSC map. The proposed approach is available in two distinct styles: the conventional NB-AFFT-SSC method and the proposed iterationwise variable sequencing based NB-AFFT-SSC (IVS-NB-AFFT-SSC) method, which classifies one designated class in each iteration. In addition, two wrapper-based feature selection methods are proposed to obtain a set of principal components (PCs) for each class of the HS image, significantly improving classification accuracy. The approach's efficacy is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on three real HS datasets, including Washington DC Mall, Salinas-A, and Botswana. The generality of the approach has been proven through the use of other well-known machine-learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and K-nearest neighbor, as wrappers in the approach. The results confirm that the proposed approach is highly effective, with the IVS approach helping users concentrate on a particular set of PCs for the class of interest.",

With the advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision, an exponential progress has been observed in their applications to agriculture, such as in plant leaf disease detection and subsequent decision making. However, the complexity and diversity in the structural background of plant leaf images pose several challenges. This article introduces a novel bag-of-features algorithm, called <italic>Upgraded Slime mould Algorithm-Bag of Features (USMA-BOF)</italic>, for an effective classification of plant leaf images. The stochastic-based upgraded USMA is proposed to determine the optimal visual words. Further, the occurrence or repetition of optimal visual features is represented through a new discrete dual complex chirplet transform (DDCCT) method. Finally, the classification is performed using two classifiers: a support vector machine (SVM) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The performance of USMA is first compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2017 benchmark functions. Then, the proposed USMA-BOF algorithm is applied on a classification dataset with binary outputs for disease identification in sustainable agriculture. The MLP classifier performs better than SVM, with an average accuracy of 0.7552 using the proposed USMA-BOF algorithm, as compared to 0.7262, 0.6989, 0.6343, and 0.7262 using the algorithms whale optimization algorithm (WOA)-BOF, adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO)-BOF, gray wolf optimization (GWO)-BOF, and SMA-BOF, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Self-driving vehicles need a robust positioning system to continue the revolution in intelligent transportation. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are most commonly used to accomplish this task because of their ability to accurately locate the vehicle in the environment. However, recent publications have revealed serious cases where GNSS fails miserably to determine the position of the vehicle, for example, under a bridge, in a tunnel, or in dense forests. In this work, we propose a framework architecture of explaining deep learning LiDAR-based (XDLL) models that predicts the position of the vehicles by using only a few LiDAR points in the environment, which ensures the required fastness and accuracy of interactions between vehicle components. The proposed framework extracts non-semantic features from LiDAR scans using a clustering algorithm. The identified clusters serve as input to our deep learning model, which relies on LSTM and GRU layers to store the trajectory points and convolutional layers to smooth the data. The model has been extensively tested with short- and long-term trajectories from two benchmark datasets, Kitti and NCLT, containing different environmental scenarios. Moreover, we investigated the obtained results by explaining the contribution of each cluster feature by using several explainable methods, including Saliency, SmoothGrad, and VarGrad. The analysis showed that taking the mean of all the clusters as an input for the model is enough to obtain better accuracy compared to the first model, and it reduces the time consumption as well. The improved model is able to obtain a mean absolute positioning error of below one meter for all sequences in the short- and long-term trajectories.",

The early detection of cervical cancer is done relatively by using the Pap Smear cell Test. This method of detection is challenged by the degradation phenomenon within the image segmentation task that arises when the superpixel count is minimized. This paper introduces a Hybrid Linear Iterative Clustering and Bayes classification-based GrabCut Segmentation Technique (HLC-BC-GCST) for the dynamic detection of Cervical cancer. In this proposed HLC-BC-GCST approach, the Linear Iterative Clustering process is employed to cluster the potential features of the preprocessed image, which is then combined with GrabCut to prevent the issues that arise when the number of superpixels is minimized. In addition, the proposed HLC-BC-GCST scheme benefits of the advantages of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) on the extracted features from the iterative clustering method, based on which the mapping is performed to describe the energy function. Then, Bayes classification is used for reconstructing the graph cut model from the extracted energy function derived from the GMM model-based Linear Iterative Clustering features for better computation and implementation. Finally, the boundary optimization method is utilized to considerably minimize the roughness of cervical cells, which contains the cytoplasm and nuclei regions, using the GrabCut algorithm to facilitate improved segmentation accuracy. The results of the proposed HLC-BC-GCST scheme are 6% better than the results obtained by other standard detection approaches of cervical cancer using graph cuts.",

      "abstract": "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well studied logistical problem along with its various variants such as VRP with customer Time-Window (VRPTW). However, all the previously studied variants assume that vehicles are mostly the same in terms of their capacity, location and home location (depot). This study uses the agent-based approach for solving VRPTW with vehicle's unique location and depot. This is to minimise the number of used vehicles as the main target. Other targets including total distance travelled, waiting time and time are also considered as criteria to evaluate the quality of the generated vehicle routes. This is achieved by proposing a Messaging Protocol-based Heuristics Optimisation (MPHO) model that balances between centrally-distributed agents' interactions and accommodates certain priority rules specifically developed for the problem. Furthermore, modifications to certain constraints checking techniques are introduced by implementing time Push Forward (PF) checking recursively tailored to the route's unique start/ending locations as well as calculating the reduced waiting time to find and check the limit of the total route duration. In order to justify the superiority of the proposed MPHO model, numerical tests have been conducted on benchmark problems including single and multiple depot instances as well as modified instances tailored to the problem. This is made possible by randomising vehicles' capacities and their unique locations and depots. Key results reveal that, in multiple depot instances, higher quality solutions compared with previous benchmark outcomes are obtained in terms of minimising the total number of vehicles along with fastest solution time (CPU) at the expense of total time and distance travelled.",

In order to design an algorithm that can flexibly adapt to different sizes of the search area, we propose an effective swarm intelligence optimization algorithm in this paper, called diversity-controlled Lamarckian quantum particle swarm optimization (DCL-QPSO). The highlights of the algorithm are a diversity-controlled strategy and a modified local search method. Integrated with the docking environment of Autodock, the DCL-QPSO is compared with Autodock Vina, Glide and other two Autodock-based search algorithms for flexible ligand docking. Experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm has a performance comparable to those of Autodock Vina and Glide for dockings within a certain area around the binding sites, and is a more effective solver than all the compared methods for dockings without prior knowledge of the binding sites.",

      "abstract": "In this article, an improved Gaussian distribution based quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (IG-QPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve engineering shape design problems with multiple constraints. In this algorithm, the Gaussian distribution is employed to generate the sequence of random numbers in the QPSO algorithm. By decreasing the variance of the Gaussian distribution linearly, the algorithm is able not only to maintain its global search ability during the early search stages, but can also obtain gradually enhanced local search ability in the later search stages. Additionally, a weighted mean best position in the IG-QPSO is employed to achieve a good balance between local search and global search. The proposed algorithm and some other well-known PSO variants are tested on ten standard benchmark functions and six well-studied engineering shape design problems. Experimental results show that the IG-QPSO algorithm can optimize these problems effectively in terms of precision and robustness compared to its competitors.",

      "abstract": "Handling missing values and large-dimensional features are crucial requirements for data-driven fault diagnosis systems. However, most intelligent data-driven diagnostic systems are not able to handle missing data. The presence of high-dimensional feature sets can also further complicate the process of fault diagnosis. This paper aims to devise a missing data imputation unit along with a dimensionality reduction unit in the pre-processing module of the diagnostic system. This paper proposes a novel pooling strategy for missing data imputation (PSMI). This strategy can simplify complex patterns of missingness and incrementally update the pool. The pre-processing module receives incomplete observations, PSMI estimates missing values, and, then, the dimensionality reduction unit transforms completed observations onto a lower-dimensional feature space. These transformed observations are then fed as inputs to the fault classification module for decision making and diagnosis. This diagnostic scheme makes use of various state-of-the-art missing data imputation, dimensionality reduction and classification algorithms. This enables a comprehensive comparison and allows to find the best techniques for the sake of diagnosing faults in the Tennessee Eastman process. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed pooling strategy and indicate that principal component analysis imputation and heteroscedastic discriminant analysis approaches outperform other imputation and dimensionality reduction techniques in this diagnostic application.",

As a result, moving to Level-4 and Level-5 autonomy in the near future is starting to look like a certain possibility. Use of AI in vehicles and, in particular, cutting-edge computer vision, signal processing and control techniques have contributed significantly to the high-tech nature of state-of-the-art Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) available in cars today. In modern automobiles, AI not only contributes substantially to systems such as ADAS, but also in the areas of vehicles’ connectivity, automotive cybersecurity, and smart road infrastructure development. The next generation driverless vehicles will be completely reliant on these technologies to transport passengers and goods from one place to other, whilst eliminating human intervention entirely. However, despite the many advancements in AI for connected and autonomous vehicles done so far, there are several issues that are responsible of holding back the wide-scale deployment of AI based autonomous vehicles on roads, which are discussed in this editorial paper. Until and unless these critical issues are addressed, it would be difficult to indicate an accurate future moment in time when autonomous vehicles will become a reality globally.",

      "abstract": "Brain tumors are a pernicious cancer with one of the lowest five-year survival rates. Neurologists often use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose the type of brain tumor. Automated computer-assisted tools can help them speed up the diagnosis process and reduce the burden on the health care systems. Recent advances in deep learning for medical imaging have shown remarkable results, especially in the automatic and instant diagnosis of various cancers. However, we need a large amount of data (images) to train the deep learning models in order to obtain good results. Large public datasets are rare in medicine. This paper proposes a framework based on unsupervised deep generative neural networks to solve this limitation. We combine two generative models in the proposed framework: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We swap the encoder–decoder network after initially training it on the training set of available MR images. The output of this swapped network is a noise vector that has information of the image manifold, and the cascaded generative adversarial network samples the input from this informative noise vector instead of random Gaussian noise. The proposed method helps the GAN to avoid mode collapse and generate realistic-looking brain tumor magnetic resonance images. These artificially generated images could solve the limitation of small medical datasets up to a reasonable extent and help the deep learning models perform acceptably. We used the ResNet50 as a classifier, and the artificially generated brain tumor images are used to augment the real and available images during the classifier training. We compared the classification results with several existing studies and state-of-the-art machine learning models. Our proposed methodology noticeably achieved better results. By using brain tumor images generated artificially by our proposed method, the classification average accuracy improved from 72.63% to 96.25%. For t",

Since the human factor is the preeminent cause behind the traffic accidents, the development of reliable Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is seen by many as a possible solution to improve road safety. ADASs rely on the car perception system input that consists of camera(s), LIDAR and/or radar to detect pedestrians and other objects on the road. Hardware improvements as well as advances done in employing Deep Learning techniques for object detection popularized the Convolutional Neural Networks in the area of autonomous driving research and applications. However, the availability of quality and large datasets continues to be a most important issue that influences the Deep Learning based model’s performance. With this in mind, this work analyses how a YOLO-based object detection architecture responded to limited data available for training and containing low-quality images. The work focused on pedestrian detection, since vulnerable road user’s safety is a major concern within AV and ADAS research communities. The proposed model was trained and tested on data gathered from Coventry, United Kingdom, city streets. The results show that the original YOLOv3 implementation reaches a 42.18 % average precision (AP), and the main challenge was in detecting small objects. Network modifications were made and our final model, based on the original YOLOv3 implementation, achieved 51.6 % AP. It is also demonstrated that the employed data augmentation approach is responsible for doubling the average precision of the final model.",

Deep learning has proven to be very popular in solving different NLP tasks in recent years as well. This paper proposes an approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve sentiment classification, by excluding the max-pooling layer from the CNN. This layer reduces the length of generated feature vectors after convolving the filters on the input data. As such, the LSTM networks will receive well-captured vectors from the feature maps.

      "abstract": "Background:A high-quality docking method tends to yield multifold gains with half pains for the new drug development. Over the past few decades, great efforts have been made for the development of novel docking programs with great efficiency and intriguing accuracy. AutoDock Vina (Vina) is one of these achievements with improved speed and accuracy compared to AutoDock4. Since it was proposed, some of its variants, such as PSOVina and GWOVina, have also been developed. However, for all these docking programs, there is still large room for performance improvement.Results:In this work, we propose a parallel multi-swarm cooperative particle swarm model, in which one master swarm and several slave swarms mutually cooperate and co-evolve. Our experiments show that multi-swarm programs possess better docking robustness than PSOVina. Moreover, the multi-swarm program based on random drift PSO can achieve the best highest accuracy of protein–ligand docking, an outstanding enrichment effect for drug-like activate compounds, and the second best AUC screening accuracy among all the compared docking programs, but with less computation consumption than most of the other docking programs.Conclusion:The proposed multi-swarm cooperative model is a novel algorithmic modeling suitable for protein–ligand docking and virtual screening. Owing to the existing coevolution between the master and the slave swarms, this model in parallel generates remarkable docking performance.

      "abstract": "With the development of autonomous vehicles, localization and mapping technologies have become crucial to equip the vehicle with the appropriate knowledge for its operation. In this paper, we extend our previous work by prepossessing a localization and mapping architecture for autonomous vehicles that do not rely on GPS, particularly in environments such as tunnels, under bridges, urban canyons, and dense tree canopies. The proposed approach is of two parts. Firstly, a K-means algorithm is employed to extract features from LiDAR scenes to create a local map of each scan. Then, we concatenate the local maps to create a global map of the environment and facilitate data association between frames. Secondly, the main localization task is performed by an adaptive particle filter that works in four steps: (a) generation of particles around an initial state (provided by the GPS); (b) updating the particle positions by providing the motion (translation and rotation) of the vehicle using an inertial measurement device; (c) selection of the best candidate particles by observing at each timestamp the match rate (also called particle weight) of the local map (with the real-time distances to the objects) and the distances of the particles to the corresponding chunks of the global map; (d) averaging the selected particles to derive the estimated position, and, finally, using a resampling method on the particles to ensure the reliability of the position estimation. The performance of the newly proposed technique is investigated on different sequences of the Kitti and Pandaset raw data with different environmental setups, weather conditions, and seasonal changes. The obtained results validate the performance of the proposed approach in terms of speed and representativeness of the feature extraction for real-time localization in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.",

Over the past few decades, various docking programs have been developed, some of them employing novel optimization algorithms. However, most of those methods cannot simultaneously achieve both good efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, it is worthwhile to pour the efforts into the development of a docking program with fast speed and high quality of the solutions obtained. The research presented in this paper, based on the docking scheme of Vina, developed a novel docking program called RDPSOVina. The RDPSOVina employes a novel search algorithm but the same scoring function of Vina. It utilizes the random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) algorithm as the global search algorithm, implements the local search with small probability, and applies Markov chain mutation to the particles' personal best positions in order to harvest more potential-candidates. To prove the outstanding docking performance in RDPSOVina, we performed the re-docking experiments on two PDBbind datasets and cross-docking experiments on the Sutherland-crossdock-set, respectively. The RDPSOVina exhibited superior protein-ligand docking accuracy and better cross-docking prediction with higher operation efficiency than most of the compared methods.

Each agent estimates the neighboring states and, according to the estimation and communication data, the detection mechanism reveals the presence of FDIA. The proposed control scheme provides resiliency to the system by replacing the conventional consensus rule with attack-resilient ones.

      "abstract": "Modern cars utilise Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in several ways. In ADAS, the use of multiple sensors to gauge the environment surrounding the ego-vehicle offers numerous advantages, as fusing information from more than one sensor helps to provide highly reliable and error-free data. The fused data is typically then fed to a tracker algorithm, which helps to reduce noise and compensate for situations when received sensor data is temporarily absent or spurious, or to counter the offhand false positives and negatives. The performances of these constituent algorithms vary vastly under different scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the variation in the performance of tracker algorithms in sensor fusion due to the alteration in external conditions in different scenarios, and on the methods for countering that variation. We introduce a sensor fusion architecture, where the tracking algorithm is spontaneously switched to achieve the utmost performance under all scenarios. By employing a Real-time Traffic Density Estimation (RTDE) technique, we may understand whether the ego-vehicle is currently in dense or sparse traffic conditions. A highly dense traffic (or congested traffic) condition would mean that external circumstances are non-linear; similarly, sparse traffic conditions would mean that the probability of linear external conditions would be higher. We also employ a Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) algorithm, which is able to monitor for construction zones, junctions, schools, and pedestrian crossings, thereby identifying areas which have a high probability of spontaneous, on-road occurrences. Based on the results received from the RTDE and TSR algorithms, we construct a logic which switches the tracker of the fusion architecture between an Extended Kalman Filter (for linear external scenarios) and an Unscented Kalman Filter (for non-linear scenarios).

It is one of the leading causes of temporary visual disability and permanent blindness. There is no cure for this disease other than a proper treatment in the early stages. Five stages of diabetic retinopathy are discussed in this paper that need to be detected followed by a proper treatment. Transfer learning is used to detect the grades of diabetic retinopathy in eye fundus images, without training from scratch. The Kaggle EyePACS dataset is one of the largest datasetsavailable publicly for experimentation. In our work, an extensive study on the Kaggle EyePACS dataset is carried out using pre-trained models ResNet50 and DenseNet121. The Aptos dataset is also used in comparison with this dataset to examine the performance of the pre-trained models. Different experiments are performed to analyze the images from the different classes in the Kaggle EyePACS dataset. This dataset has significant challenges including image noise, imbalanced classes, and fault annotations. Our work highlights potential problems within the datasetand the conflicts between the classes. A clustering technique is used to get informative images from the normal class to improve the model’s accuracy to 70%.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, inspired from the idea that the contextual distances and positions may have a substantial impact on distinguishing the relationships between words, a novel word association method with two weighting schemes for refining contexts, named as Weighted Point-wise Mutual Information with Contextual Distances and Positions (PMIDP), is proposed to eliminate the noisy and redundant information hidden in an imbalanced corpus. One weighting scheme, called PMIdist, revises the Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) method by scaling the co-occurrence counts according to the distance between a word and the context. The second weighting scheme is a ratio that can measure the contextual position variation within the window of a given word. Then, the refined word association in PMIDP is defined as the multiplication of the two proposed weighting schemes, which essentially aims to flexibly adjust the word association when solving target-oriented similarity tasks. The proposed word association method has been applied on two widely known models, i.e., the positive PMI matrix with truncated Singular Vector Decomposition (PPMI-SVD) model and the Global Vectors (GloVe) model. Experimental results demonstrate that the PMIDP method can significantly improve the performances of the two models on both semantic and relational similarity tasks and show advantages when compared with other state-of-the-art models.",

Recently, machine learning methods have gained popularity for automatizing liver transplant allocation systems, which enables prompt and suitable selection of recipients. Nevertheless, raw medical data often contain complexities such as missing values and class imbalance that reduce the reliability of the constructed model. This paper aims at eliminating the respective challenges to ensure the reliability of the decision-making process. To this aim, we first propose a novel deep learning method to simultaneously eliminate these challenges and predict the patients' survival chance. Secondly, a hybrid framework is designed that contains three main modules for missing data imputation, class imbalance learning, and classification, each of which employing multiple advanced techniques for the given task. Furthermore, these two approaches are compared and evaluated using a real clinical case study.

Since MRI can present tissues of interest in both morphological and functional images, various segmentation techniques have been employed for this. The algorithms based on Markov random field (MRF) have shown strong abilities in dealing with noisy image segmentation compared to other methods. In this article, inspired by the random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) algorithm, we propose a novel hybrid framework based on a combination of the RDPSO with the hidden MRF model and the expectation–maximization algorithm (HMRF-EM), to be used for MRI segmentation in real-time environments. The proposed hybrid framework is compared with the standalone HMRF-EM method, two other MRF-based stochastic relaxation algorithms, and two widely used brain tissue segmentation toolboxes on both simulated and real MRI datasets. The experimental results prove that the proposed hybrid framework can obtain better segmentation results than most of its competitors and has faster convergence speed than the compared stochastic optimization algorithms.",

This work makes use of an unsupervised learning method, called hierarchical clustering, in an attempt to create an artificial sensor to detect two different cyber-sabotage cases, known as false data injection and denial-of-service, during the dynamic behavior of the power system. The detection process is conducted by using an unsupervised learning-enhanced approach, and a decision tree regressor is then employed for removing the threat. The dynamic state estimation of the power system is done by Kalman filters, which provide benefits in terms of the speed and accuracy of the process. Measurement devices in utilities and buses are vulnerable to communication interruptions between phasor measurement units and operators, who can be easily manipulated by false data. While Kalman filters are incapable of detecting the majority of such cyber-attacks, this article proves that the proposed unsupervised machine learning method is able to detect more than 90 percent of the mentioned attacks. The simulation results on the IEEE 9-bus with 3-machines and IEEE 14-bus with 5-machines systems verify the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

These associated uncertainties occur because the arrival of a truck to pick up the container is random, so the departure time of the container is unknown. The problem investigated in this paper emerges when newly arrived containers of different sizes, types and weights require storage operation in the same yard where other containers have already been stored. This situation becomes more challenging when the time of departure of existing container is not known. This study develops a new Fuzzy Knowledge-Based optimisation system named ‘FKB_GA’ for optimal storage and retrieval of containers in a yard that contains long stay pre-existing containers. The containers’ duration of stay factor is considered along with two other factors such as the similarity (containers with same customer) and the quantity of containers per stack.A new Multi-Layered Genetic Algorithm module is proposed which identifies the optimal fuzzy rules required for each set of fired rules to achieve a minimum number of container re-handlings when selecting a stack. An industrial case study is used to demonstrate the applicability and practicability of the developed system.",

Many factors and constraints need to be considered when modelling this storage allocation problem. These constraints include the size, type and weight of the containers. The factors are the number of containers in a stack and the duration of stay of the topmost container in the stack. This paper aims to develop an improved Fuzzy Knowledge-Based ‘FKB’ model for best allocationpractice of long-stay containers in a yard. In this model, the duration of stay factor does not need to be considered in the allocation decision if the duration of stay for the topmost containers in a stack is similar; hence, a new ‘ON/OFF’ strategy is proposed within the Fuzzy Knowledge-Based model to activate/deactivate this factor in the stacking algorithm whenever is required. Discrete Event Simulation and Fuzzy Knowledge-Based techniques are used to develop the proposed model. The model’s behaviour is tested using three real-life scenarios, including allocating containers in busy, moderately busy and quiet yards. The total number of re-handlings, the number of re-handlings per stack, and the number of re-handlings for containers were considered KPIs in each scenario.",

Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks have found use in challenging time-dependent applications such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), financial analysis and sensor fusion due to their capability to cope with the vanishing gradient problem. GRUs are also known to be more computationally efficient than their variant, the Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM), due to their less complex structure and as such, are more suitable for applications requiring more efficient management of computational resources. Many of such applications require a stronger mapping of their features to further enhance the prediction accuracy. A novel Quaternion Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU) is proposed in this paper, which leverages the internal and external dependencies within the quaternion algebra to map correlations within and across multidimensional features. The QGRU can be used to efficiently capture the inter- and intra-dependencies within multidimensional features unlike the GRU, which only captures the dependencies within the sequence. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a sensor fusion problem involving navigation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) deprived environments as well as a human activity recognition problem. The results obtained show that the QGRU produces competitive results with almost 3.7 times fewer parameters compared to the GRU.

      "abstract": "Considering that most popular models solving aspect-level sentiment classification problems mainly focus on designing complicated neural networks to scale the importance of each word in the sentence, this paper addresses this problem from the view of semantic space. Motivated by the fact that the senses of a word can be sophisticatedly embedded into the semantic space using a distributed representation, this paper hypothesizes that each sense of a word can be represented by one or more specific dimensions, and thus the target of aspect-level sentiment classification can be simplified into searching the related dimensions for the aspects and sentiments concerned. Particularly, an Attention Vector (ATV) based on attention mechanism is designed for each aspect in terms of a specific task, which involves two sub-vectors, i.e., a Dimension Attention Vector (DATV) and a Sentiment Attention Vector (SATV). The DATV determines the significances of different dimensions based on their correlations with an aspect; and the SATV allocates weights for the attributes of words, which are decided by sentiment polarities and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging. Given a sub-dataset related to an aspect, the ATV will be optimized by an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the objective of which is to maximize classification accuracy. Intrinsically, the DATV can reduce the ambiguity existing in polysemy, meanwhile, the SATV is an auxiliary means for the optimization of the DATV, which can help eliminate the misunderstandings caused by antonyms. Then, the optimized DATV will be applied on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model via simply scaling the pretrained word embeddings as inputs (named as ATV-CNN model). Experimental results show that the ATV-CNN model can have substantial advantages when compared with state-of-the-art models.",

As mono‐sensor systems cannot provide reliable and consistent readings under all circum-stances because of errors and other limitations, fusing data from multiple sensors ensures that the environmental parameters are perceived correctly and reliably for most scenarios, thereby substan-tially improving the reliability of the multi‐sensor‐based automotive systems. This paper first high-lights the significance of efficiently fusing data from multiple sensors in ADAS features. An emergency brake assist (EBA) system is showcased using multiple sensors, namely, a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor and camera. The architectures of the proposed ‘centralised’ and ‘decentral-ised’ sensor fusion approaches for EBA are discussed along with their constituents, i.e., the detection algorithms, the fusion algorithm, and the tracking algorithm. The centralised and decentralised architectures are built and analytically compared, and the performance of these two fusion architectures for EBA are evaluated in terms of speed of execution, accuracy, and computational cost. While both fusion methods are seen to drive the EBA application at an acceptable frame rate (~20fps or higher) on an Intel i5‐based Ubuntu system, it was concluded through the experiments and analyt-ical comparisons that the decentralised fusion‐driven EBA leads to higher accuracy; however, it has the downside of a higher computational cost. The centralised fusion‐driven EBA yields compara-tively less accurate results, but with the benefits of a higher frame rate and lesser computational cost.",

      "abstract": "The random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) algorithm is an effective random search technique inspired by the trajectory analysis of the canonical PSO and the free electron model in metal conductors placed in an external electric field. However, like other PSO variants, the RDPSO algorithm also inevitably encounters premature convergence when solving multimodal problems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel diversity collaboratively guided (DCG) strategy for the RDPSO algorithm that enhances the search ability of the algorithm. In this strategy, two kinds of diversity measures are defined and modified in a collaborative manner. Specifically, the whole search process of the RDPSO is divided into three phases based on the changes in the two diversity measures. In each phase, different values are selected for the key parameters of the update equation in the RDPSO to make the particle swarm perform different search modes. Consequently, the improved RDPSO algorithm with the DCG strategy (DCG-RDPSO) can maintain its diversity dynamically at a certain level, and thus can search constantly without stagnation until the search process terminates. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is done on the CEC-2013 benchmark suite, in comparison with several versions of RDPSO, different variants of PSO and several non-PSO evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed DCG strategy can significantly improve the performance and robustness of the RDPSO algorithm for most of the multimodal problems. Further experiments on economic dispatch problems also verify the effectiveness of the DCG strategy.",

The results show that the performance of the proposed DMO-QPSO is better than other five algorithms in solving most of these test problems. Moreover, we further study the impact of two different decomposition approaches, i.e., the penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) and Tchebycheff (TCH) approaches, as well as the polynomial mutation operator on the algorithmic performance of DMO-QPSO.",

      "abstract": "Recognizing human activities has become a trend in smart surveillance that contains several challenges, such as performing effective analyses of huge video data streams, while maintaining low computational complexity, and performing this task in real-time. Current activity recognition techniques are using convolutional neural network (CNN) models with computationally complex classifiers, creating hurdles in obtaining quick responses for abnormal activities. To address these challenges in real-time surveillance, this paper proposes a lightweight deep learning-assisted framework for activity recognition. First, we detect a human in the surveillance stream using an effective CNN model, which is trained on two surveillance datasets. The detected individual is tracked throughout the video stream via an ultra-fast object tracker called the ‘minimum output sum of squared error’ (MOSSE). Next, for each tracked individual, pyramidal convolutional features are extracted from two consecutive frames using the efficient LiteFlowNet CNN. Finally, a novel deep skip connection gated recurrent unit (DS-GRU) is trained to learn the temporal changes in the sequence of frames for activity recognition. Experiments are conducted over five benchmark activity recognition datasets, and the results indicate the efficiency of the proposed technique for real-time surveillance applications compared to the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "The safety of vulnerable road users is of paramount importance as transport moves towards fully automated driving. The richness of real-world data required for testing autonomous vehicles is limited and furthermore, available data do not present a fair representation of different scenarios and rare events. Before deploying autonomous vehicles publicly, their abilities must reach a safety threshold, not least with regards to vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. In this paper, we present a novel Generative Adversarial Networks named the Ped-Cross GAN. Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate crossing sequences of pedestrians in the form of human pose sequences. The Ped-Cross GAN is trained with the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. The novel Pedestrian Scenario dataset, derived from existing datasets, enables training on richer pedestrian scenarios. We demonstrate an example of its use through training and testing the Ped-Cross GAN. The results show that the Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate new crossing scenarios that are of the same distribution from those contained in the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. Having a method with these capabilities is important for the future of transport, as it will allow for the adequate testing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on how they correctly perceive the intention of pedestrians crossing the street, ultimately leading to fewer pedestrian casualties on our roads.",

The collected measurements are firstly fed into a feature selection module, where multiple state-of-the-art techniques have been used to extract the most informative features from the initial set of available features. The selected features are inputs to a knockoff generation module, where the generative adversarial networks are employed to generate the corresponding knockoffs of the selected features. The generated knockoffs are then fed into a classification module, in which two different classification models are used for the sake of fault diagnosis. Multiple experiments have been designed to investigate the effect of noise, fault resistance value, and sampling rate on the performance of the proposed framework. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through a comprehensive study on the IEEE 118-bus system.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has gained immense attention from researchers in medicine, especially in medical imaging. The main bottleneck is the unavailability of sufficiently large medical datasets required for the good performance of deep learning models. This paper proposes a new framework consisting of one variational autoencoder (VAE), two generative adversarial networks, and one auxiliary classifier to artificially generate realistic-looking skin lesion images and improve classification performance. We first train the encoder-decoder network to obtain the latent noise vector with the image manifold’s information and let the generative adversarial network sample the input from this informative noise vector in order to generate the skin lesion images. The use of informative noise allows the GAN to avoid mode collapse and creates faster convergence. To improve the diversity in the generated images, we use another GAN with an auxiliary classifier, which samples the noise vector from a heavy-tailed student t-distribution instead of a random noise Gaussian distribution. The proposed framework was named TED-GAN, with T from the t-distribution and ED from the encoder-decoder network which is part of the solution. The proposed framework could be used in a broad range of areas in medical imaging. We used it here to generate skin lesion images and have obtained an improved classification performance on the skin lesion classification task, rising from 66% average accuracy to 92.5%. The results show that TED-GAN has a better impact on the classification task because of its diverse range of generated images due to the use of a heavy-tailed t-distribution.",

The lack of a public and robust benchmark dataset has however hindered the advancement in the research, comparison and adoption of recent machine learning techniques such as deep learning techniques to learn the error in the INS for a more accurate positioning of the vehicle. In order to facilitate the benchmarking, fast development and evaluation of positioning algorithms, we therefore present the first of its kind large-scale and information-rich inertial and odometry focused public dataset called IO-VNBD (Inertial Odometry Vehicle Navigation Benchmark Dataset). The vehicle tracking dataset was recorded using a research vehicle equipped with ego-motion sensors on public roads in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, and France. The sensors include a GPS receiver, inertial navigation sensors, wheel-speed sensors amongst other sensors found in the car, as well as the inertial navigation sensors and GPS receiver in an Android smart phone sampling at 10 Hz. A diverse number of driving scenarios were captured such as traffic congestion, round-abouts, hard-braking, etc. on different road types (e.g. country roads, motorways, etc.) and with varying driving patterns. The dataset consists of a total driving time of about 40 h over 1,300 km for the vehicle extracted data and about 58 h over 4,400 km for the smartphone recorded data. We hope that this dataset will prove valuable in furthering research on the correlation between vehicle dynamics and dependable positioning estimation based on vehicle ego-motion sensors, as well as other related studies.",

The INS can be used to continuously position autonomous vehicles during GNSS signal losses around urban canyons, bridges, tunnels and trees, however, it suffers from unbounded exponential error drifts cascaded over time during the multiple integrations of the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements to position. More so, the error drift is characterised by a pattern dependent on time. This paper proposes several efficient neural network-based solutions to estimate the error drifts using Recurrent Neural Networks, such as the Input Delay Neural Network (IDNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (vRNN), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). In contrast to previous papers published in literature, which focused on travel routes that do not take complex driving scenarios into consideration, this paper investigates the performance of the proposed methods on challenging scenarios, such as hard brake, roundabouts, sharp cornering, successive left and right turns and quick changes in vehicular acceleration across numerous test sequences. The results obtained show that the Neural Network-based approaches are able to provide up to 89.55% improvement on the INS displacement estimation and 93.35% on the INS orientation rate estimation.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential to solve many traffic problems, such as accidents, congestion and pollution. However, there are still challenges to overcome, for instance, AVs need to accurately perceive their environment to safely navigate in busy urban scenarios. The aim of this paper is to review recent articles on computer vision techniques that can be used to build an AV perception system. AV perception systems need to accurately detect non-static objects and predict their behaviour, as well as to detect static objects and recognise the information they are providing. This paper, in particular, focuses on the computer vision techniques used to detect pedestrians and vehicles. There have been many papers and reviews on pedestrians and vehicles detection so far. However, most of the past papers only reviewed pedestrian or vehicle detection separately. This review aims to present an overview of the AV systems in general, and then review and investigate several detection computer vision techniques for pedestrians and vehicles. The review concludes that both traditional and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for pedestrian and vehicle detection; however, DL techniques have shown the best results. Although good detection results have been achieved for pedestrians and vehicles, the current algorithms still struggle to detect small, occluded, and truncated objects. In addition, there is limited research on how to improve detection performance in difficult light and weather conditions. Most of the algorithms have been tested on well-recognised datasets such as Caltech and KITTI; however, these datasets have their own limitations. Therefore, this paper recommends that future works should be implemented on more new challenging datasets, such as PIE and BDD100K.",

To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios.",

In the absence of GNSS signals, information on the speed of the wheels of a vehicle (or other robots alike), recorded from the wheel encoder, can be used to provide continuous positioning information for the vehicle, through the integration of the vehicle's linear velocity to displacement. However, the displacement estimation from the wheel speed measurements are characterised by uncertainties, which could be manifested as wheel slips or/and changes to the tyre size or pressure, from wet and muddy road drives or tyres wearing out. As such, we exploit recent advances in deep learning to propose the Wheel Odometry neural Network (WhONet) to learn the uncertainties in the wheel speed measurements needed for correction and accurate positioning. The performance of the proposed WhONet is first evaluated on several challenging driving scenarios, such as on roundabouts, sharp cornering, hard-brake and wet roads (drifts). WhONet's performance is then further and extensively evaluated on longer-term GNSS outage scenarios of 30 s, 60 s, 120 s and 180 s duration, respectively over a total distance of 493 km.

The more data we use, the more computational power is required too. Recent advancements in quantum computing show promising advantages in dealing with this kind of computational issues we face while training a complex machine-learning algorithm.

The research question posed by this research is of how can we train a computer to be able to see and perceive a pedestrian’s movement. This work presents a dual network architecture, trained in tandem, which is capable of classifying the behaviour of a pedestrian from a single image with no prior context. The results show that the most successful network was able to achieve a correct classification accuracy of 94.3% when classifying images based on their behaviour. This shows the use of a novel data fusion method for pedestrian images and human poses. Having a network with these capabilities is important for the future of transport, as it will allow vehicles to correctly perceive the intention of pedestrians crossing the street, and will ultimately lead to fewer pedestrian casualties on our roads.",

The current smoke detection methods are applicable to only normal surveillance videos, providing unsatisfactory results for video streams captured from foggy environments, due to challenges related to clutter and unclear contents. In this paper, an energy-friendly edge intelligence-assisted smoke detection method is proposed using deep convolutional neural networks for foggy surveillance environments. Our method uses a light-weight architecture, considering all necessary requirements regarding accuracy, running time, and deployment feasibility for smoke detection in an industrial setting, compared to other complex and computationally expensive architectures including AlexNet, GoogleNet, and visual geometry group (VGG).

      "abstract": "Low-cost inertial navigation sensors (INS) can be exploited for a reliable tracking solution for autonomous vehicles. However, position errors grow exponentially due to noises in the measurements. Several deep learning techniques have been investigated to mitigate the errors for a better navigation solution [1-10]. However, these studies have involved the use of different datasets not made publicly available. The lack of a robust benchmark dataset has thus hindered the advancement in the research, comparison and adoption of deep learning techniques for vehicle positioning based on inertial navigation. In order to facilitate the benchmarking, fast development and evaluation of positioning algorithms, we therefore present the first of its kind large-scale and information-rich inertial and odometry focused public dataset called IO-VNBD (Inertial Odometry Vehicle Navigation Benchmark Dataset).The vehicle tracking dataset was recorded using a research vehicle equipped with ego-motion sensors on public roads in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, and France. The sensors include a GPS receiver, inertial navigation sensors, wheel-speed sensors amongst other sensors found on the car as well as the inertial navigation sensors and GPS receiver in an android smart phone sampling at 10HZ. A diverse number of scenarios and vehicle dynamics are captured such as traffic, round-abouts, hard-braking etc. on different road types (country roads, motorways etc.) with varying driving patterns. The dataset consists of a total driving time of about 40 hours over 1,300km for the vehicle extracted data and about 58 hours over 4,400 km for the smartphone recorded data. We hope that this dataset will prove valuable in furthering research on the correlation between vehicle dynamics and its displacement as well as other related studies",

      "abstract": "Road localisation of autonomous vehicles is reliant on consistent accurate GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) positioning information. Commercial GNSS receivers usually sample at 1 Hz, which is not sufficient to robustly and accurately track a vehicle in certain scenarios, such as driving on the highway, where the vehicle could travel at medium to high speeds, or in safety-critical scenarios. In addition, the GNSS relies on a number of satellites to perform triangulation and may experience signal loss around tall buildings, bridges, tunnels and trees. An approach to overcoming this problem involves integrating the GNSS with a vehicle-mounted Inertial Navigation Sensor (INS) system to provide a continuous and more reliable high rate positioning solution. INSs are however plagued by unbounded exponential error drifts during the double integration of the acceleration to displacement. Several deep learning algorithms have been employed to learn the error drift for a better positioning prediction. We therefore investigate in this chapter the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Input Delay Neural Network (IDNN), Multi-Layer Neural Network (MLNN) and Kalman Filter (KF) for high data rate positioning. We show that Deep Neural Network-based solutions can exhibit better performances for high data rate positioning of vehicles in comparison to commonly used approaches like the Kalman filter.",

In this paper, we present a novel approach for plagiarism detection without reference collections. The proposed approach relies on using some statistical properties of the most common words, and the Latent Semantic Analysis that is applied to extract the most common words usage patterns. This method aims to generate a model of author’s “style” by revealing a set of certain features of authorship. The model generation procedure focuses on just one author, as an attempt to summarise the aspects of an author’s style in a definitive and clear-cut manner. The feature set of the intrinsic model were based on the frequency of the most common words, their relative frequencies in the book series, and the deviation of these frequencies across all books for a particular author. The approach has been evaluated using the leave-one-out-cross-validation method on the CEN (Corpus of English Novel) data set. Results have indicated that, by integrating deep latent semantic and stylometric analyses, hidden changes can be identified when a reference collection does not exist. The results have also shown that our Multi-Layer Perceptron based approach statistically outperforms Bayesian Network, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest models, by accurately predicting the author classes with an overall accuracy of 97%.",

The method proposed in this paper uses a discriminant dictionary for matrix recovery and completion in order to find the lowest rank representation of the data matrix. As the algorithm performs clustering operations in low-dimensional latent space, the computational efficiency of the algorithm is higher, which is also a major advantage of the proposed algorithm in this paper.

      "abstract": "Inspired from the idea that the contexts in which a word occurs are of different significance, this paper proposes a novel method, called word representation with Salient Features (SaFe), to represent words using salient features selected from the context words. The SaFe method employs the point-wise mutual information (PMI) method with scaled context window to measure word association between a target word and its context. Then, contexts having word associations will be selected as salient features, where the number of salient features for a given word is decided by the ratio between the number of unique contexts and the total counts of occurrences in the whole corpus. The SaFe method can be used with the positive PMI matrix (PPMI), with each row representing a word, hence the name SaFe-PPMI. Moreover, the SaFe-PPMI model can be further decomposed by using the truncated singular vector decomposition technique to obtain dense vectors. In addition to efficient computation, the new models can achieve remarkable improvements in seven semantic relatedness tasks, and they show superior performance when compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "The management of container yard operations is considered by yard operators to be a very challenging task due to the many uncertainties inherent in such operations.The storage of the containers is one of those operations that require proper management for the efﬁcient utilisation of the yard, requiring rapid retrieval time and a minimum number of re-handlings. The main challenge is when containers of a different size, type, or weight need to be stored in a yard that holds a number of pre-existing containers. This challenge becomes even more complex when the date and time for the departure of the containers are unknown, as is the case when the container is collected by a third-party logistics company without any prior notice being given. The aim of this study is to develop a new system for the management of container yard operationsthat takes into consideration a number of factors and constraints that occur in a real-life situation. One of these factors is the duration of stay for the topmost containers of each stack, when the containers are stored. Because theduration of stay for containers in a yard varies dynamically over time, an ‘ON/OFF’ strategy is proposed to activate/deactivate the duration of stay factor constraint if the length of stay for these containers varies signiﬁcantly overtime. A number of tools and techniques are utilised for developing the proposed system including: discrete event simulation for the modelling of container storage and retrieval operations, a fuzzy know ledge-based model forthe stack allocation of containers, and a heuristic algorithm called ‘neighbourhood’ for the container retrieval operation. Results show that by adopting the proposed ‘ON/OFF’ strategy, 5% of the number of re-handlings, 2.5% of the total retrieval time, 6.6% of the total re-handling time and42% of the average waiting time per truck are reduced.",

In this paper, we extend our previous work, originally presented in Ruiz-Garcia et al.

We expand on previous work by presenting a new hybrid deep learning emotion recognition model and preliminary results using this model on real-time emotion recognition performed by our humanoid robot. The hybrid emotion recognition model combines a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for self-learnt feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for emotion classification. Compared to more complex approaches that use more layers in the convolutional model, this hybrid deep learning model produces state-of-the-art classification rate of 96.26 % , when tested on the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces dataset (Lundqvist et al. in The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces—KDEF, 1998), and offers similar performance on unseen data when tested on the Extended Cohn–Kanade dataset (Lucey et al. in: Proceedings of the third international workshop on CVPR for human communicative behaviour analysis (CVPR4HB 2010), San Francisco, USA, pp 94–101, 2010).

      "abstract": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm has shown competitive performance for handling various optimization problems. However, despite its strong global search ability, it suffers from a poor convergence rate and it loses the balance between exploitation and exploration. To compensate for this weakness, our paper proposes a cellular structured neighborhood, with Gaussian-based search equation and local attractor, and a redefined probability calculation for the ABC algorithm after an empirical analysis. The proposed algorithm is named as CGABC-Cellular neighborhood with Gaussian distribution ABC. The cellular automata (CA) model can keep individuals interact with specific neighbors while maintaining the population diversity. The Gaussian-based search equation combined with the local attractor can help exploit locally the search space, and the modified probability calculation based on rank sorting can make the selection of onlooker bees more robust and appropriate. Theoretical analysis are made to prove the global convergence of the CGABC algorithm based on the theory of probability metric spaces, and the results show that CGABC will converge to the global optimum. The proposed algorithm is tested on a set of benchmark functions and three real-world problems (the “Lennard Jones potential problem”, the “frequency-modulated sound wave synthesis problem” and the “feature selection problem”), and the results demonstrate that our proposed strategies help ABC achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence when compared with other ABC variants and swarm-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs).",

The SCAE model learns to encode facial expression images and produce a feature vector with relatively similar illumination, regardless of the luminance level of the input image. Moreover, we propose fine-tuning the stacked shallow autoencoders after each one of these is trained greedily, rather than just at the end, and show that this approach significantly improves the set of illumination invariant features learnt by the SCAE. Finally, we propose the use of a variant rectifier linear unit transfer function that helps the SCAE model reduce or increase the illumination of images with high or low luminance, and show that the lower and upper bounds greatly influence classification performance.

      "abstract": "Human robot interaction is a rapidly growing topic of interest in today’s society. The development of real time emotion recognition will further improve the relationship between humans and social robots. However, contemporary real time emotion recognition in unconstrained environments has yet to reach the accuracy levels achieved on controlled static datasets. In this work, we propose a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pre-trained as a Stacked Convolutional Autoencoder (SCAE) in a greedy layer-wise unsupervised manner, for emotion recognition from facial expression images taken by a NAO robot. The SCAE model is trained to learn an illumination invariant down-sampled feature vector. The weights of the encoder element are then used to initialize the CNN model, which is fine-tuned for classification. We train the model on a corpus composed of gamma corrected versions of the CK+, JAFFE, FEEDTUM and KDEF datasets. The emotion recognition model produces a state-of-the-art accuracy rate of 99.14% on this corpus. We also show that the proposed training approach significantly improves the CNN’s generalisation ability by over 30% on nonuniform data collected with the NAO robot in unconstrained environments.",

However, non-existence of publicly available datasets that contain obfuscation and distortion of fingerprints makes it difficult to identify the type of alteration. In this work we present the publicly available Sokoto-Coventry Fingerprints Dataset (SOCOFing), which provides ten fingerprints for 600 different subjects, as well as gender, hand and finger name for each image, among other unique characteristics. We also provide a total of 55,249 images with three levels of alteration for Z-cut, obliteration and central rotation synthetic alterations, which are the most common types of obfuscation and distortion. In addition, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify these alterations. The proposed CNN model achieves a classification accuracy rate of 98.55%. Results are also compared with a residual CNN model pre-trained on ImageNet, which produces an accuracy of 99.88%.",

In a wideband frequency co-operative spectrum sensing, different CR nodes can be assigned to different frequency bands to detect the spectrum hole. Spectrum hole is a 3-dimensional concept, where space, time and frequency are involved. By estimating the probable distance, time and frequency of primary user and applying transmit power control to the CR node, we can maximize the spectrum efficiency. Since in D2D (Device to Device) communication, the distance of communication is shorter and the propagation delays can be estimated, we can perform very accurate transmit power control. Using a 3-dimensional spectrum detector to detect spectrum holes in space, time and frequency will yield higher spectrum efficiency because it enhances the degrees of freedom from 1 to 3 and, hence, provides flexibility to use resources with lowest probability of interference.",

      "year": "2017",
      "abstract": "The strategic design of logistic networks, such as roads, railways or mobile phone networks, is essential for efficiently managing emergency situations. The geographic coordinate systems could be used to produce new traveling salesman problem (TSP) instances with geographic information systems (GIS) features. The current paper introduces a recurrent framework designed for building a sequence of instances in a systematic way. The framework intends to model real-life random adverse events manifested on large areas, as massive rainfalls or the arrival of a polar front, or targeted relief supply in early stages of the response. As a proof of concept for this framework, we use the first Romanian TSP instance with the main human settlements, in order to derive several sequences of instances. Nowadays state-of-the-art algorithms for TSP are used to solve these instances. A branch-and-cut algorithm delivers the integer exact solutions, using substantial computing resources. An implementation of the Lin–Kernighan heuristic is used to rapidly find very good near-optimal integer solutions to the same instances. The Lin–Kernighan heuristic shows stability on the tested instances. Further work could be done to better exploit GIS features in order to efficiently tackle operations on large areas and to test the solutions delivered by other algorithms on new instances, derived using the introduced framework.The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10115-016-0938-8",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition is critical for everyday living and is essential for meaningful interaction. If we are to progress towards human and machine interaction that is engaging the human user, the machine should be able to recognize the emotional state of the user. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proven to be efficient in emotion recognition problems. The good degree of performance achieved by these classifiers can be attributed to their ability to self-learn a down-sampled feature vector that retains spatial information through filter kernels in convolutional layers. Given the view that random initialization of weights can lead to convergence to non-optimal local minima, in this paper we explore the impact of training the initial weights in an unsupervised manner. We study the effect of pre-training a Deep CNN as a Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder (SCAE) in a greedy layer-wise unsupervised fashion for emotion recognition using facial expression images. When trained with randomly initialized weights, our CNN emotion recognition model achieves a performance rate of 91.16% on the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) dataset. In contrast, when each layer of the model, including the hidden layer, is pre-trained as an Auto-Encoder, the performance increases to 92.52%. Pre-training our CNN as a SCAE also reduces training time marginally. The emotion recognition model developed in this work will form the basis of a real-time empathic robot system.",

      "year": "2017",
      "abstract": "Using short URLs in Twitter messages has increased in popularity in the past few years. This is mostly due to the fact that Twitter, as one of the most popular social media networks, imposes a 140 character limit to the messages distributed over the network. This paper analyzes the use of short URLs by Twitter users. Specifically, the goal is to examine the content pointed by the short URLs as well as the potential impact on the performance of sentiment analysis (opinion mining) tasks. Opinion mining based on Twitter feed has been used in an array of applications, including healthcare, identifying public opinion on political issues, financial modeling and advertising. Past research has however completely disregarded tweets which contain URLs. It is not hard to see how opinion mining can be improved considering the fact that Twitter users regularly post URLs pointing to articles endorsing a particular political figure, articles in important financial outlets or reviews of products. This study is based on the analysis of three distinct Twitter datasets with varying number of tweets which include short URLs. Popular machine learning techniques used in opinion mining were deployed in different experimental settings to conclude which are the most lucrative options. © 2017 IEEE.",

In this paper, we have developed a new integrated approach for extrinsic plagiarism detection. The proposed approach is based on four well-known models namely Bag of Words (BOW), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Stylometry and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The proposed approach works by capturing usage patterns of the most common words (MCW) from books of 25 authors. Stylistic features for each author were harnessed in the method by adjusting the LSA weighting technique. The adjusted LSA method was trained in a novel manner using the leave-one-out-cross-validation technique and compared with the traditional LSA method. The results have shown that the enhanced weighting method of the adjusted LSA outperforms the traditional LSA method.",

      "abstract": "Many optimization problems have huge solution spaces, deep restrictions, highly correlated parameters, and operate with uncertain or inconsistent data. Such problems sometimes elude the usual solving methods we are familiar with, forcing us to continuously improve these methods or to even completely reconsider the solving methodologies. When decision makers need faster and better results to more difficult problems, the quality of a decision support system is crucial. To estimate the quality of a decision support system when approaching difficult problems is not easy, but is very important when designing and conducting vital industrial processes or logistic operations. This paper studies the resilience of a solving method, initially designed for the static and deterministic TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) variant, when applied to an uncertain and dynamic TSP version. This investigation shows how a supplementary level of complexity can be successfully handled. The traditional ant-based system under investigation is infused with a technique which allows the evaluation of its performances when uncertain input data are present. Like the real ant colonies do, the system rapidly adapts to repeated environmental changes. A comparison with the performance of another heuristic optimization method is also done.",

This paper presents a novel automatic screening system for diabetic retinopathy that focuses on the detection of the earliest visible signs of retinopathy, which are microaneurysms.

The detection of the microaneurysms at an early stage is vital, and it is the first step in preventing the diabetic retinopathy. The paper first explores the existing systems and applications related to diabetic retinopathy screening, with a focus on the microaneurysm detection methods. The proposed decision support system consists of an automatic acquisition, screening and classification of diabetic retinopathy colour fundus images, which could assist in the detection and management of the diabetic retinopathy. Several feature extraction methods and the circular Hough transform have been employed in the proposed microaneurysm detection system, alongside the fuzzy histogram equalisation method. The latter method has been applied in the preprocessing stage of the diabetic retinopathy eye fundus images and provided improved results for detecting the microaneurysms.",

LRR-related algorithms have many applications in computer vision, signal processing, semi-supervised learning and pattern recognition. However, most of the existing LRR methods fail to take into account the non-linear geometric structures within data, thus the locality and the similarity information among data may be missing in the learning process, which have been shown to be beneficial for discriminative tasks. To improve LRR in this regard, we propose a manifold locality constrained low-rank representation framework (MLCLRR) for data representation. By taking the local manifold structure of the data into consideration, the proposed MLCLRR method not only can represent the global low-dimensional structures, but also capture the local intrinsic non-linear geometric information in the data. The experimental results on different types of vision problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

However, sometimes, for example in health informatics, we are confronted not a small number of data sets or rare events, and with complex problems where aML-approaches fail or deliver unsatisfactory results. Here, interactive Machine Learning (iML) may be of help and the “human-in-the-loop” approach may be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems, where human expertise can help to reduce an exponential search space through heuristics. In this paper, experiments are discussed which help to evaluate the effectiveness of the iML-“human-in-the-loop” approach, particularly in opening the “black box”, thereby enabling a human to directly and indirectly manipulating and interacting with an algorithm. For this purpose, we selected the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) framework, and use it on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) which is of high importance in solving many practical problems in health informatics, e.g. in the study of proteins.",

The proposed classifier can properly classify multi-class data with complex and variously shaped decision boundaries among the different classes of faults and the fault-free state, and is robust against noise.

      "abstract": "In many traditional machine learning methods, sampling is only a process of acquiring training data. However, some studies (on sequential Markov chains and particle filters) have demonstrated that sampling can be used for solving some intractable optimization problems in classical learning methods. Along this line of thinking, the relationships between sampling and learning are theoretically exploited in this paper, wherein the key feature of the sampling process is selecting representative samples from original data that can be modeled by a probability distribution. In theory, acquiring reliable samples is not an easy task for an arbitrary probability distribution. Motivated by approaches in evolutionary computation, rejection sampling and function approximation, a novel sampling strategy, called the evolutionary sampling, is proposed in this paper, and a machine learning method, called the evolutionary sampling approach (ESA), is put forward afterwards. Within ESA, a computing model, called the support sample model (SSM), is presented as well and is used to approximate an original density function. Accordingly, a concrete implementation of an evolutionary sampling approach (ESA) is proposed to seek the optimal model parameters of the SSM. Benefiting from the combination of rejection sampling and evolutionary searching, the ESA can theoretically converge to the optimal solution by minimizing the total variation distance, and can do this with high computational efficiency. Moreover, the normalized factor of a density function can be automatically estimated with high precision within the ESA. As a result, the ESA may be suitable for machine learning problems that could be transformed into density function approximation problems within a probabilistic framework. In addition, derived from the rejection sampling strategy, the ESA can also have online learning abilities required by large-scale data stream processing tasks. Theoretical analyses and application studies are",

Firstly, the motivation of the RDPSO algorithm is presented and the design of the particle’s velocity equation is described in detail. Secondly, a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm is made in order to gain a deep insight into how the RDPSO algorithm works. It involves a theoretical analysis and the simulation of the stochastic dynamical behavior of a single particle in the RDPSO algorithm. The search behavior of the algorithm itself is also investigated in detail, by analyzing the interaction among the particles. Then, some variants of the RDPSO algorithm are presented by incorporating different random velocity components with different neighborhood topologies. Finally, empirical studies of the RDPSO algorithm are performed by using a set of benchmark functions from the CEC2005 benchmark suite. Based on the theoretical analysis of the particle’s behavior, two methods of controlling the algorithmic parameters are employed, followed by an experimental analysis on how to select the parameter values, in order to obtain a satisfactory overall performance of the RDPSO algorithm and its variants in real-world applications. A further performance comparison between the RDPSO algorithm and other variants of PSO is made to prove the effectiveness of the RDPSO.",

A fuzzy semantic-based similarity model for uncovering obfuscated plagiarism is presented and compared with five state-of-the-art baselines. Semantic relatedness between words is studied based on the part-of-speech (POS) tags and WordNet-based similarity measures. Fuzzy-based rules are introduced to assess the semantic distance between source and suspicious texts of short lengths, which implement the semantic relatedness between words as a membership function to a fuzzy set. In order to minimize the number of false positives and false negatives, a learning method that combines a permission threshold and a variation threshold is used to decide true plagiarism cases. The proposed model and the baselines are evaluated on 99,033 ground-truth annotated cases extracted from different datasets, including 11,621 (11.7%) handmade paraphrases, 54,815 (55.4%) artificial plagiarism cases, and 32,578 (32.9%) plagiarism-free cases. We conduct extensive experimental verifications, including the study of the effects of different segmentations schemes and parameter settings. Results are assessed using precision, recall, F-measure and granularity on stratified 10-fold cross-validation data. The statistical analysis using paired t-tests shows that the proposed approach is statistically significant in comparison with the baselines, which demonstrates the competence of fuzzy semantic-based model to detect plagiarism cases beyond the literal plagiarism. Additionally, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test shows the effectiveness of different segmentation schemes used with the proposed approach.",

The problem is stated as a data-driven nonlinear regression problem, which is converted into a nonlinear programming problem with many nonlinear differential and algebraic constraints. Due to the typical ill conditioning and multimodality nature of the problem, it is in general difficult for gradient-based local optimization methods to obtain satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, many stochastic optimization methods have been employed to find the global solution of the problem. Results: This paper presents an effective search strategy for a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm that enhances the ability of the algorithm for estimating the parameters of complex dynamic biochemical pathways. The proposed algorithm is a new variant of random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO), which is used to solve the above mentioned inverse problem and compared with other well known stochastic optimization methods. Two case studies on estimating the parameters of two nonlinear biochemical dynamic models have been taken as benchmarks, under both the noise-free and noisy simulation data scenarios. Conclusions: The experimental results show that the novel variant of RDPSO algorithm is able to successfully solve the problem and obtain solutions of better quality than other global optimization methods used for finding the solution to the inverse problems in this study.",

Therefore, in the process of new product development (NPD), it is essential to analyse and understand the customer behaviour in buying new products, in order to satisfy the customer needs. NPD is a complex process involving a series of activities, in different stages, from understanding the market needs to developing a new product and satisfying various technical and product lifecycle requirements. In order to successfully deliver profitable new products to the market, a number of challenging issues in each activity have to be dealt with.

Contrary to Darwin, and according to Lamarck and Baldwin, organisms in natural systems learn to adapt over their lifetime and allow to adjust over generations. Whereas earlier research was rather reserved, more recent research underpinned by the work of Lamarck and Baldwin, finds that these theories have much potential, particularly in upcoming fields such as epigenetics. In this paper, we report on some experiments with different evolutionary algorithms with the purpose to improve the accuracy of data mining methods. We explore whether and to what extent an optimisation goal can be reached through a calculation of certain parameters or attribute weightings by use of such evolutionary strategies. We provide a look at different EAs inspired by the theories of Darwin, Lamarck, and Baldwin, as well as the problem solving methods of certain species. In this paper we demonstrate that the modification of well-established machine learning techniques can be achieved in order to include methods from genetic algorithm theory without extensive programming effort. Our results pave the way for much further research at the cross section of machine learning optimisation techniques and evolutionary algorithm research.",

      "abstract": "Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are a fascinating branch of computational intelligence with much potential for use in many application areas. The fundamental principle of EAs is to use ideas inspired by the biological mechanisms observed in nature, such as selection and genetic changes, to find the best solution for a given optimization problem. Generally, EAs use iterative processes, by growing a population of solutions selected in a guided random search and using parallel processing, in order to achieve a desired result. Such population based approaches, for example particle swarm and ant colony optimization (inspired from biology), are among the most popular metaheuristic methods being used in machine learning, along with others such as the simulated annealing (inspired from thermodynamics). In this paper, we provide a short survey on the state-of-the-art of EAs, beginning with some background on the theory of evolution and contrasting the original ideas of Darwin and Lamarck; we then continue with a discussion on the analogy between biological and computational sciences, and briefly describe some fundamentals of EAs, including the Genetic Algorithms, Genetic Programming, Evolution Strategies, Swarm Intelligence Algorithms (i.e., Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Bacteria Foraging Algorithms, Bees Algorithm, Invasive Weed Optimization), Memetic Search, Differential Evolution Search, Artificial Immune Systems, Gravitational Search Algorithm, Intelligent Water Drops Algorithm. We conclude with a short description of the usefulness of EAs for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining tasks and present some open problems and challenges to further stimulate research.",

The pre-processing module bridges a gap between the residual generation and decision modules. The inputs of the pre-processing module are batches of residuals generated by a combined set of observers that are robust to operating point changes. The outputs of the pre-processing module are the latent residuals which are progressively fed into the decision module, a dynamic weighting ensemble of fault classifiers that incrementally learns the residuals-faults relationships and dynamically classifies the faults including multiple new classes. The pre-processing module consists of the Wold cross-validation algorithm along with the non-linear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) that projects the residual to the new feature space, extracts the latent information among the residuals and estimates the optimal number of principal components to form the latent residuals. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of this approach, even in the incomplete scenarios, i.e., the missing data in the batches of generated residuals due to sensor failures",

      "abstract": "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are powerful tools for multiple sequence alignment (MSA), which is known to be an NPcomplete and important problem in bioinformatics. Learning HMMs is a difficult task, and many meta-heuristic methods, including particle swarm optimization (PSO), have been used for that. In this paper, a new variant of PSO, called the random drift particle swarmoptimization (RDPSO) algorithm, is proposed to be used for HMM learning tasks in MSA problems. The proposed RDPSO algorithm, inspired by the free electron model in metal conductors in an external electric field, employs a novel set of evolution equations that can enhance the global search ability of the algorithm. Moreover, in order to further enhance the algorithmic performance of the RDPSO, we incorporate a diversity control method into the algorithm and, thus, propose an RDPSO with diversity-guided search (RDPSODGS). The performances of the RDPSO, RDPSO-DGS and other algorithms are tested and compared by learning HMMs for MSA on two well-known benchmark data sets. The experimental results show that the HMMs learned by the RDPSO and RDPSO-DGS are able to generate better alignments for the benchmark data sets than other most commonly used HMM learning methods, such as the Baum-Welch and other PSO algorithms. The performance comparison with well-known MSA programs, such as ClustalW and MAFFT, also shows that the proposed methods have advantages in multiple sequence alignment.",

This issue occurs when the number of examples representing the class of interest is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. We shortly review the many issues in machine learning and applications of this problem, by introducing the characteristics of the imbalanced dataset scenario in classification, presenting the specific metrics for evaluating performance in class imbalanced learning and enumerating the proposed solutions. In particular, we will describe preprocessing, cost-sensitive learning and ensemble techniques, carrying out an experimental study to contrast these approaches in an intra and inter-family comparison. We will carry out a thorough discussion on the main issues related to using data intrinsic characteristics in this classification problem. This will help to improve the current models with respect to: the presence of small disjuncts, the lack of density in the training data, the overlapping between classes, the identification of noisy data, the significance of the borderline instances, and the dataset shift between the training and the test distributions. Finally, we introduce several approaches and recommendations to address these problems in conjunction with imbalanced data, and we will show some experimental examples on the behavior of the learning algorithms on data with such intrinsic characteristics.",

Unfortunately, network structural inference is time consuming and there is an increasing need to infer the structure of ever-larger networks. This article presents the Dense Structural Expectation Maximisation (DSEM) algorithm, a novel extension of the well-known SEM algorithm. DSEM increases the efficiency of structural inference by using the time-expensive calculations required in each SEM iteration more efficiently, and can be O(N) times faster than SEM, where N is the size of the network. The article has also combined DSEM with parallelisation and evaluated the impact of these improvements over SEM, individually and combined. The possibility of combining these novel approaches with other research on structural inference is also considered. The contributions also appear to be usable for all kinds of structural inference, and may greatly improve the range, variety and size of problems which can be tractably addressed.

      "year": "2012",
      "abstract": "One common and challenging problem faced by many bioinformatics applications, such as promoter recognition, splice site prediction, RNA gene prediction, drug discovery and protein classification, is the imbalance of the available datasets. In most of these applications, the positive data examples are largely outnumbered by the negative data examples, which often leads to the development of sub-optimal prediction models having high negative recognition rate (Specificity = SP) and low positive recognition rate (Sensitivity = SE). When class imbalance learning methods are applied, usually, the SE is increased at the expense of reducing some amount of the SP. In this paper, we point out that in these data-imbalanced bioinformatics applications, the goal of applying class imbalance learning methods would be to increase the SE as high as possible by keeping the reduction of SP as low as possible. We explain that the existing performance measures used in class imbalance learning can still produce sub-optimal models with respect to this classification goal. In order to overcome these problems, we introduce a new performance measure called Adjusted Geometric-mean (AGm). The experimental results obtained on ten real-world imbalanced bioinformatics datasets demonstrates that the AGm metric can achieve a lower rate of reduction of SP than the existing performance metrics, when increasing the SE through class imbalance learning methods. This characteristic of AGm metric makes it more suitable for achieving the proposed classification goal in imbalanced bioinformatics datasets learning.",

This paper presents a convergence analysis and performance evaluation of the QPSO algorithm and it also proposes two variants of the QPSO algorithm. First, we investigate in detail the convergence of the QPSO algorithm on a probabilistic metric space and prove that the QPSO algorithm is a form of contraction mapping and can converge to the global optimum. This is the first time that the theory of probabilistic metric spaces has been employed to analyze a stochastic optimization algorithm. We provided a new definition for the convergence rate of a stochastic algorithm as well as definitions for three types of convergence according to the correlations between the convergence rate and the objective function values. With these definitions, the effectiveness of the QPSO is evaluated by computing and analyzing the time complexity and the convergence rate of the algorithm. Then, the QPSO with random mean best position (QPSO-RM) and the QPSO with ranking operator (QPSO-RO) are proposed as two improvements of the QPSO algorithm.

Although it has been shown to perform well in finding the optimal solutions for many optimization problems, there has so far been little analysis on how it works in detail. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the QPSO algorithm. In the theoretical analysis, we analyze the behavior of a single particle in QPSO in terms of probability measure. Since the particle's behavior is influenced by the contraction-expansion (CE) coefficient, which is the most important parameter of the algorithm, the goal of the theoretical analysis is to find out the upper bound of the CE coefficient, within which the value of the CE coefficient selected can guarantee the convergence or boundedness of the particle's position. In the experimental analysis, the theoretical results are first validated by stochastic simulations for the particle's behavior. Then, based on the derived upper bound of the CE coefficient, we perform empirical studies on a suite of well-known benchmark functions to show how to control and select the value of the CE coefficient, in order to obtain generally good algorithmic performance in real world applications. Finally, a further performance comparison between QPSO and other variants of PSO on the benchmarks is made to show the efficiency of the QPSO algorithm with the proposed parameter control and selection methods.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, neural networks have been applied to develop short-term traffic flow predictors. The past traffic flow data, captured by on-road sensors, is used as input patterns of neural networks to forecast future traffic flow conditions. The amount of input patterns captured by the on-road sensors is usually huge, but not all input patterns are useful when trying to predict the future traffic flow. The inclusion of useless input patterns is not effective to developing neural network models. Therefore, the selection of appropriate input patterns, which are significant for short-term traffic flow forecasting, is essential. This can be conducted by setting an appropriate configuration of input nodes of the neural network; however, this is usually conducted by trial and error. In this paper, the Taguchi method, which is a robust and systematic optimization approach for designing reliable and high-quality models, is proposed for the purpose of determining an appropriate neural network configuration, in terms of input nodes, in order to capture useful input patterns for traffic flow forecasting. The effectiveness of the Taguchi method is demonstrated by a case study, which aims to develop a short-term traffic flow predictor based on past traffic flow data captured by on-road sensors located on a Western Australia freeway. Three advantages of using the Taguchi method were demonstrated: 1) short-term traffic flow predictors with high accuracy can be designed; 2) the development time for short-term traffic flow predictors is reasonable; and 3) the accuracy of short-term traffic flow predictors is robust with respect to the initial settings of the neural network parameters during the learning phase.",

In this article, the authors investigate the usage of structural information of scientific publications in both problems, and the consideration of citation evidence in the second problem. Three statistical measures namely Inverse Generic Class Frequency, Spread, and Depth are introduced to assign a degree of importance (i.e., weight) to structural components in scientific articles. A term-weighting scheme is adjusted to incorporate component-weight factors, which is used to improve the retrieval of potential sources of plagiarism. A plagiarism screening process is applied based on a measure of resemblance, in which component-weight factors are exploited to ignore less or nonsignificant plagiarism cases. Using the notion of citation evidence, parts with proper citation evidence are excluded, and remaining cases are suspected and used to calculate the similarity index. The authors compare their approach to two flat-based baselines, TF-IDF weighting with a Cosine coefficient, and shingling with a Jaccard coefficient. In both baselines, they use different comparison units with overlapping measures for plagiarism screening. They conducted extensive experiments using a dataset of 15,412 documents divided into 8,657 source publications and 6,755 suspicious queries, which included 18,147 plagiarism cases inserted automatically. Component-weight factors are assessed using precision, recall, and F -measure averaged over a 10- fold cross-validation and compared using the ANOVA statistical test. Results from structural-based candidate retrieval and plagiarism detection are evaluated statistically against the flat baselines using paired-t tests on 10-fold cross-validation runs, wh",

Simulations show that the proposed secure routing protocol achieved better event-delivery and event-dropping ratios compared to the original directed diffusion protocol.

Different from most other popular methods in high dimensional bio-medical data analysis, such as microarray gene expression or proteomics mass spectroscopy data analysis, fuzzy rule-based models can not only provide good classification results, but also easily be explained and interpreted in human understandable terms, by using fuzzy rules. However, the advantages offered by fuzzy-based techniques in microarray data analysis have not yet been fully explored in the literature. Although some recently developed fuzzy-based modeling approaches can provide satisfactory classification results, the rule bases generated by most of the reported fuzzy models for gene expression data are still too large to be easily comprehensible.Results: In this paper, we develop some Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms based Interpretable Fuzzy (MOEAIF) methods for analysing high dimensional bio-medical data sets, such as microarray gene expression data and proteomics mass spectroscopy data. We mainly focus on evaluating our proposed models on microarray gene expression cancer data sets, i.e., the lung cancer data set and the colon cancer data set, but we extend our investigations to other type of cancer data set, such as the ovarian cancer data set. The experimental studies have shown that relatively simple and small fuzzy rule bases, with satisfactory classification performance, can be successfully obtained for challenging microarray gene expression datasets.Conclusions: We believe that fuzzy-based techniques, and in particular the methods proposed in this paper, can be very useful tools in dealing with high dimensional cancer data. We also argue that the potential of applying fuzzy-based techniques to microarray data analysis need to be further explored.",

The distributions and diversities of the local attractor points in GAQPSO and QPSO are evaluated and compared. For the purpose of comparison, two variants of the GAQPSO algorithm are proposed by using a mutation probability and other types of probability distribution. The GAQPSO has been comprehensively evaluated on the suite of CEC2005 benchmark functions, and the experimental results are compared with those of the PSO and QPSO algorithms based on different probability distributions. It is shown by the results that the GAQPSO algorithm is an effective approach that can improve the QPSO performance considerably, that is, the GAQPSO algorithm is less likely to be stuck in local optima and hence it can achieve better solutions in most cases.",

However, the random oversampling method would increase the computational cost associated with the SVM training largely due to the addition of new training examples. In this paper we present an investigation carried out to develop efficient resampling methods that can produce comparable classification results to the random oversampling results, but with the use of less amount of data. The main idea of the proposed methods is to first select the most informative data examples located closer to the class boundary region by using the separating hyperplane found by training an SVM model on the original imbalanced dataset, and then use only those examples in resampling. We demonstrate that it would be possible to obtain comparable classification results to the random oversampling results through two sets of efficient resampling methods which use 50% less amount of data and 75% less amount of data, respectively, compared to the sizes of the datasets generated by the random oversampling method.",

One approach that some research has used is to cluster the data and then infer a structural model of the clusters. When using this kind of approach it is very important to choose the clustering algorithm carefully. In this paper we explicitly analyse the attributes that make a clustering algorithm appropriate, and we also consider how to measure the quality of the identified clusters. Our analysis leads us to develop three novel cluster quality measures that are based on regulatory overlap. Using these measures we evaluate two modern candidate algorithms: FLAME, and KMART. Although FLAME was specifically developed for clustering gene expression profile data, we find that KMART is probably a better algorithm to use if the goal is to infer a structural model of the clusters.",

      "abstract": "Support vector machines (SVMs) is a popular machine learning technique, which works effectively with balanced datasets. However, when it comes to imbalanced datasets, SVMs produce suboptimal classification models. On the other hand, the SVM algorithm is sensitive to outliers and noise present in the datasets. Therefore, although the existing class imbalance learning (CIL) methods can make SVMs less sensitive to class imbalance, they can still suffer from the problem of outliers and noise. Fuzzy SVMs (FSVMs) is a variant of the SVM algorithm, which has been proposed to handle the problem of outliers and noise. In FSVMs, training examples are assigned different fuzzy-membership values based on their importance, and these membership values are incorporated into the SVM learning algorithm to make it less sensitive to outliers and noise. However, like the normal SVM algorithm, FSVMs can also suffer from the problem of class imbalance. In this paper, we present a method to improve FSVMs for CIL (called FSVM-CIL), which can be used to handle the class imbalance problem in the presence of outliers and noise. We thoroughly evaluated the proposed FSVM-CIL method on ten real-world imbalanced datasets and compared its performance with five existing CIL methods, which are available for normal SVM training. Based on the overall results, we can conclude that the proposed FSVM-CIL method is a very effective method for CIL, especially in the presence of outliers and noise in datasets.",

Further, the importance of large, genome-wide structural inference is increasingly recognised, but there does not appear to be a good simulator available for large networks. This paper presents GREENSIM, a simulator that helps address this gap. GREENSIM automatically generates large, genome-size networks with more biologically realistic structural characteristics and 2nd-order non-linear regulatory functions. The simulator itself and the novel method used for generating a network structure with appropriate in- and out-degree distributions may also generalise easily to other types of network.

      "abstract": "In class imbalance learning, the performance measure used for the model selection would play a vital role. It has been well-studied in the past research that the most widely used performance measure, the overall accuracy of the model, can lead to sub-optimal classification models when learning from imbalanced datasets. In order to overcome this problem, other performance measures, such as the Geometric-mean (Gm) and F-measure (Fm), have been used for imbalanced dataset learning. Training a classifier system with an imbalanced dataset (where the positive class is the minority class) would usually produce sub-optimal models having a higher Specificity (SP) and a lower Sensitivity (SE). By applying class imbalance learning methods, we would often be able to increase the SE by sacrificing some amount of SP. In some type of real world imbalanced classification problems, such as the gene finding Bioinformatics problems, it is important to improve the SE as much as possible by keeping the reduction of SP to the minimum. In this paper, we show that with respect to this type of classification problems the existing performance measures used in class imbalance learning (Gm and Fm) can still result in sub-optimal classification models. In order to circumvent these problems, we introduced a new performance measure, called Adjusted Geometric-mean (AGm). We show, both analytically and empirically on two real-world Bioinformatics datasets, that AGm can perform better than Gm and Fm metrics.",

Because of the paucity of available data and high levels of associated noise, machine learning is essential to performing good and tractable inference of the underlying causal structure. This chapter serves as a review of the GRN field as a whole, as well as a roadmap for researchers new to the field. It describes the relevant theoretical and empirical biochemistry and the different types of GRN inference. It also describes the data that can be used to perform GRN inference. With this biologically-centred material as background, the chapter surveys previous applications of machine learning techniques and computational intelligence to GRN inference. It describes clustering, logical and mathematical formalisms, Bayesian approaches and some combinations. Each of these is shortly explained theoretically, and important examples of previous research using each are highlighted. Finally, the chapter analyses wider statistical problems in the field, and concludes with a summary of the main achievements of previous research as well as some open research questions in the field.",

However, the existing computational methods do not address this issue completely or successfully. Here we present the development of an effective classifier system (named as microPred) for this classification problem by using appropriate machine learning techniques. Our approach includes the introduction of more representative datasets, extraction of new biologically relevant features, feature selection, handling of class imbalance problem in the datasets and extensive classifier performance evaluation via systematic cross-validation methods. Results: Our microPred classifier yielded higher and, especially, much more reliable classification results in terms of both sensitivity (90.02%) and specificity (97.28%) than the exiting pre-miRNA classification methods. When validated with 6095 non-human animal pre-miRNAs and 139 virus pre-miRNAs from miRBase, microPred resulted in 92.71% (5651/6095) and 94.24% (131/139) recognition rates, respectively.",

A NF based learning and adaptation of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models is used for residual generation, while for residual evaluation a NF network for Mamdani models is used. The NF network for Takagi-Sugeno models is trained with data collected from a full scale UTSG simulator and is used for generating residuals in the fault detection step. A locally linear neuro-fuzzy (LLNF) model is used in the identification of the steam generator. This model is trained using the locally linear model tree (LOLIMOT) algorithm. In the fault isolation part, genetic algorithms are employed to train a Mamdani type NF network, which is used to classify the residuals and take the appropriate decision regarding the actual behavior of the process. Furthermore, a qualitative description of faults is then extracted from the fuzzy rules obtained from the Mamdani NF network. Experimental results presented in the final part of the paper confirm the effectiveness of this approach.",

In this case, adaptive Web sites is the case study to exemplify the tools introduced in the text. In the following paragraphs I use the later view to give the reader a quick tour about the book's content.The authors start by introducing the Web and motivating the need for adaptive Web sites, which is mainly commercial. The second chapter introduces the main concepts behind a Web site: its operation, its associated data and structure, user sessions, etc. Chapter three explains the Web mining process and the tools to analyze Web data, mainly focused in machine learning. The fourth chapter looks at how to store and manage data, as in a popular Web site we can generate gigabytes of logs in a short period of time. Chapter five looks at the three main and different mining tasks: content, links and usage. The following chapter covers Web personalization, a crucial topic if we want to adapt our site to specific groups of people. Chapter seven shows how to use information extraction techniques to find user behavior patterns. The subsequent chapter explains how to acquire and maintain knowledge extracted from the previous phase. Finally, chapter nine contains the case study where all the previous concepts are applied to present a framework to build adaptive Web sites.In other words, the authors have taken care of writing a self-contained book for people who want to learn and apply personalization and adaptation in Web sites. This is commendable considering the large and increasing bibliography in these and related topics. The writing is easy to follow and although the coverage",

During the heading control, there are many moments of time when the rudder command to control the yaw angle has a negative influence on roll oscillations. The prediction of the wave influence on the roll motion can be used to implement an intelligent heading control system, which is added to the mono-variable autopilot, generating only rudder commands with damping or non-increasing effects over roll movements. In this paper, aspects of roll angle and roll rate prediction using feed-forward neural networks are discussed. A neural network predictor of the roll rate, based on measured values of the roll angle, is proposed. The neural architecture is analyzed using different training data sets and noise conditions. The predictor has on-line adaptive characteristics and is working well even if both training and testing sets are affected by measurement noise.",

As each gene in DNA is preceded by a promoter sequence, the successful location of an E. coli promoter leads to the identification of the corresponding E. coli gene in the DNA sequence. A set of 324 known E. coli promoters and a set of 429 known non-promoter sequences were encoded using four different encoding methods. The encoded sequences were then used to train four different neural networks. The classification results of the four individual neural networks were then combined through an aggregation function, which used a variation of the logarithmic opinion pool method. The weights of this function were determined by a genetic algorithm. The multi-classifier system was then tested on 159 known promoter sequences and 171 non-promoter sequences not contained in the training set. The results obtained through this study proved that the same data set, when presented to neural networks in different forms, can provide slightly varying results. It also proves that when different opinions of more classifiers on the same input data are integrated within a multi-classifier system, we can obtain results that are better than the individual performances of the neural networks. The performances of our multi-classifier system outperform the results of other prediction systems for E. coli promoters developed so far.",

The human diagnostician relies on deep knowledge about the structure and the behaviour of the system, along with shallow knowledge on fault-to-manifestation patterns acquired from practice. This paper proposes a general approach to embed deep and shallow knowledge in neural network models for fault diagnosis by abduction, using neural sites for logical aggregation of manifestations and faults. All types of abduction problems were considered. The abduction proceeds by plausibility and relevance criteria multiply applied. The neural network implements plausibility by feed-forward links between manifestations and faults, and relevance by competition links between faults. Abduction by plausibility and relevance is also used for decision on the next best test along the diagnostic refinement. A case study on an installation in a rolling mill plant is presented.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we propose a unified approach for integrating implicit and explicit knowledge in neurosymbolic systems as a combination of neural and neuro-fuzzy modules. In the developed hybrid system, training data set is used for building neuro-fuzzy modules, and represents implicit domain knowledge. The explicit domain knowledge on the other hand is represented by fuzzy rules, which are directly mapped into equivalent neural structures. The aim of this approach is to improve the abilities of modular neural structures, which are based on incomplete learning data sets, since the knowledge acquired from human experts is taken into account for adapting the general neural architecture. Three methods to combine the explicit and implicit knowledge modules are proposed. The techniques used to extract fuzzy rules from neural implicit knowledge modules are described. These techniques improve the structure and the behavior of the entire system. The proposed methodology has been applied in the field of air quality prediction with very encouraging results. These experiments show that the method is worth further investigation.",
